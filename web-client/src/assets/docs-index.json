GitHub: https://github.com/SlideRuleEarth/sliderule Documentation: https://slideruleearth.io/web/ Web Client: https://client.slideruleearth.io/ Provisioning System: https://ps.slideruleearth.io/ PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/sliderule/ Conda: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sliderule Node.js: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sliderule/sliderule Purpose of this Site This documentation is intended to explain how to use SlideRule and its accompanying Python client. SlideRule is a web service for on-demand science data processing, which provides researchers and other Earth science data systems low-latency access to customized data products using processing parameters supplied at the time of the request. SlideRule runs in AWS us-west-2 and has access to ICESat-2, GEDI, Landsat, ArcticDEM, REMA, and a growing list of other datasets stored in S3. While SlideRule can be accessed by any http client (e.g. curl) by making GET and POST requests to the SlideRule service, the python packages in this repository provide higher level access to SlideRule by hiding the GET and POST requests inside python function calls that accept basic python variable types (e.g. dictionaries, lists, numbers), and returns GeoDataFrames. “Using SlideRule” typically means running a Python script you’ve developed to analyze Earth science data, and in that script calling functions in the sliderule Python package to make processing requests to SlideRule web services to perform some of the data intensive parts of your analysis. Most of the documentation and examples we provide are focused on this use-case. We do provide other means of interacting with SlideRule, most notably the web client at https://client.slideruleearth.io, both those aspects of the project are less documented.

      "content": "ICESat-2 Module ICESat-2 Module The ICESat-2 module within SlideRule supports a number of both legacy p-series and s-series endpoints, as well as the newer DataFrame-based x-series endpoints. This document focuses on the x-series endpoints while still referencing the other legacy endpoints when helpful. Three main kinds of data are returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints: segmented photon data, elevation data (from the ATL06-SR algorithm), and vegetation data (from the PhoREAL algorithm). All data returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints are organized around the concept of an extent. An extent is a variable length, customized ATL03 segment. It takes the ATL03 photons and divides them up based on their along-track distance, filters them, and then packages them together a single new custom segment. Given that the ICESat-2 standard data products have a well defined meaning for segment, SlideRule uses the term extent to indicate this custom-length and custom-filtered segment of photons. The following processing flags are used for all ICESat-2 endpoints: 0x0001: Along track spread too short 0x0002: Too few photons 0x0004: Maximum iterations reached 0x0008: Out of bounds 0x0010: Underflow 0x0020: Overflow In addition, most endpoints support the generation of a name filter using the granule parameter: rgt: Reference ground track cycle: Orbit cycle region: ATL03 region {1 to 14} version: ATL03 release version (e.g. 007) 1. ATL03 - atl03x The SlideRule atl03x endpoint provides a service for ATL03 custom processing. This endpoint queries ATL03 input granules for photon heights and locations based on a set of photon-input parameters that select geographic and temporal ranges. It then selects a subset of these photons based on a set of photon classification parameters, and divides these selected photons into short along-track extents, each of which is suitable for generating a single height estimate.",

These extends may or may not align with the original 20-m segments of ATL03 photons. The len parameter specifies the length of each extent, and the _res_parameter specifies the distance between subsequent extent centers. If res is less than len, subsequent segments will contain duplicate photons. The API may also select photons based on their along-track distance, or based on the segment-id parameters in the ATL03 product (see the dist_in_seg parameter). len: length of each extent in meters res: step distance for successive extents in meters dist_in_seg: true|false flag indicating that the units of the len and res are in ATL03 segments (e.g. if true then a len=2 is exactly 2 ATL03 segments which is approximately 40 meters) Extents are optionally filtered based on the number of photons in each extent and the distribution of those photons.

Ancillary data returned from the atl03x (as well as theatl03s and atl03sp) APIs are per-photon values that are read from the ATL03 granules. No processing is performed on the data read out of the ATL03 granule. The fields must come from either a per-photon variable (atl03_ph_fields), or a per-segment variable (atl03_geo_fields). The atl03_geo_fields, atl03_ph_fields, and atl08_fields are used to specify additional fields in the ATL03 and ATL08 granules to be returned with the photon extent and dowstream customized products. Each field provided by the user will result in a corresponding column added to the returned GeoDataFrame. Note: if a field is requested that is already present in the default GeoDataFrame, then the name of both fields will be changed to include a _x suffix for the default incusion of the field, and a _y for the ancillary inclusion of the field. In general, they should have the same value, but in some cases the ancillary field goes through different processing steps and may possibly contain a different value.",

      "content": "The data goes through a series of processing steps before being returned back to the user as per-extent (i.e. variable-length segment) result values. When a user requests an ATL08 ancillary field, the ATL08 classifications are automatically enabled with all unclassified photons filtered out (i.e. noise, ground, canopy, and top of canopy are included; unclassified photons are excluded). If the user is also requesting PhoREAL processing, then noise photons are automatically filtered out as well. Lastly, if the user manually specifies which ATL08 photon classifications to use, then that manual specification takes precedence and is used. If a user manually specifies that unclassified photons are to be included, the value used for an ancillary field for that photon has all 1’s in the binary encoding of that value. For example, if it is an 8-bit unsigned integer, the value would be 255. If it is a double-precision floating point, the value would be -nan. Since the ATL08 APIs return per-extent values and not per-photon values, the set of per-photon ancillary field values must be reduced in some way to a single per-extent value to be returned back to the user. There are currently two options available for how this reduction occurs. Nearest Neighbor (Mode): the value that appears most often in the extent is selected. This is the default method. For example, if a user specifies `atl08_fields”: [“asr”]`` in their parameters, and the PhoREAL extent consists of mostly two-thirds of one ATL08 segment, and a third of the next ATL08 segment (and if the photons rate is consistent across those two ATL08 segments), then the value returned by the nearest neighbor processing will be the ATL08 land_segment value from the first ATL08 segment. Interpolation (Average): the value that is the average of all the per-photon values provided.

      "content": "While all data returned from SlideRule for ATL03/06/08 endpoints include the extent ID (as extent_id), by default the Python client strips it out when it creates the final GeoDataFrame. There is an option to keep the extend ID by setting the “keep_id” argument in the atl03/06/08 group of Python functions to True. This is useful when performing merges on GeoDataFrames from multiple APIs (for example, you can combine results from atl06 and atl08 endpoints and created a single GeoDataFrame with both elevation and vegatation data in it). Result times returned by SlideRule for legacy endpoints are in standard Unix nanoseconds, while times provided in the ICESat-2 standard data products are in seconds from the ATLAS Epoch. The server-side code performs this conversion for you. But if you are using ICESat-2 products direction in addition to SlideRule results, and need to convert between them, you must first convert the unix time to standard GPS time, and then you need to subtract the number of seconds between the GPS epoch which is January 6, 2018 at midnight (1980-01-06T00:00:00.000000Z) and the ATLAS SDP epoch of January 1, 2018 at midnight (2018-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z). That number is 1198800018 seconds. A.1 Segmented Photon Data - atl03sp The photon data is stored as along-track segments inside the ATL03 granules, which is then broken apart by SlideRule and re-segmented according to processing parameters supplied at the time of the request. The new segments are called extents. When the length of an extent is 40 meters, and the step size is 20 meters, the extent matches the ATL06 segments. Most of the time, the photon extents are kept internal to SlideRule and not returned to the user. But there are some APIs that do return raw photon extents for the user to process on their own. Even though this offloads processing on the server, the API calls can take longer since more data needs to be returned to the user, which can bottleneck over the network.",

Callbacks For large processing requests, it is possible that the data returned from the API is too large or impractical to fit in the local memory of the Python interpreter making the request. In these cases, certain APIs in the SlideRule Python client allow the calling application to provide a callback function that is called for every result that is returned by the servers. If a callback is supplied, the API will not return back to the calling application anything associated with the supplied record types, but assumes the callback fully handles processing the data. The callback function takes the following form: callback(record, session) Callback that handles the results of a processing request for the given record.",

      "content": "ICESat-2 Module ICESat-2 Module The ICESat-2 module within SlideRule supports a number of both legacy p-series and s-series endpoints, as well as the newer DataFrame-based x-series endpoints. This document focuses on the x-series endpoints while still referencing the other legacy endpoints when helpful. Three main kinds of data are returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints: segmented photon data, elevation data (from the ATL06-SR algorithm), and vegetation data (from the PhoREAL algorithm). All data returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints are organized around the concept of an extent. An extent is a variable length, customized ATL03 segment. It takes the ATL03 photons and divides them up based on their along-track distance, filters them, and then packages them together a single new custom segment. Given that the ICESat-2 standard data products have a well defined meaning for segment, SlideRule uses the term extent to indicate this custom-length and custom-filtered segment of photons. The following processing flags are used for all ICESat-2 endpoints: 0x0001: Along track spread too short 0x0002: Too few photons 0x0004: Maximum iterations reached 0x0008: Out of bounds 0x0010: Underflow 0x0020: Overflow In addition, most endpoints support the generation of a name filter using the granule parameter: rgt: Reference ground track cycle: Orbit cycle region: ATL03 region {1 to 14} version: ATL03 release version (e.g. 007) 1. ATL03 - atl03x The SlideRule atl03x endpoint provides a service for ATL03 custom processing. This endpoint queries ATL03 input granules for photon heights and locations based on a set of photon-input parameters that select geographic and temporal ranges. It then selects a subset of these photons based on a set of photon classification parameters, and divides these selected photons into short along-track extents, each of which is suitable for generating a single height estimate.",

Each field provided by the user will result in a corresponding column added to the returned GeoDataFrame. Note: if a field is requested that is already present in the default GeoDataFrame, then the name of both fields will be changed to include a _x suffix for the default incusion of the field, and a _y for the ancillary inclusion of the field.

      "content": "The data goes through a series of processing steps before being returned back to the user as per-extent (i.e. variable-length segment) result values. When a user requests an ATL08 ancillary field, the ATL08 classifications are automatically enabled with all unclassified photons filtered out (i.e. noise, ground, canopy, and top of canopy are included; unclassified photons are excluded). If the user is also requesting PhoREAL processing, then noise photons are automatically filtered out as well. Lastly, if the user manually specifies which ATL08 photon classifications to use, then that manual specification takes precedence and is used. If a user manually specifies that unclassified photons are to be included, the value used for an ancillary field for that photon has all 1’s in the binary encoding of that value. For example, if it is an 8-bit unsigned integer, the value would be 255. If it is a double-precision floating point, the value would be -nan. Since the ATL08 APIs return per-extent values and not per-photon values, the set of per-photon ancillary field values must be reduced in some way to a single per-extent value to be returned back to the user. There are currently two options available for how this reduction occurs. Nearest Neighbor (Mode): the value that appears most often in the extent is selected. This is the default method. For example, if a user specifies `atl08_fields”: [“asr”]`` in their parameters, and the PhoREAL extent consists of mostly two-thirds of one ATL08 segment, and a third of the next ATL08 segment (and if the photons rate is consistent across those two ATL08 segments), then the value returned by the nearest neighbor processing will be the ATL08 land_segment value from the first ATL08 segment. Interpolation (Average): the value that is the average of all the per-photon values provided. This is only performed when the user appends a “%” to the end of the field’s name in the field list parameter.",

      "content": "While all data returned from SlideRule for ATL03/06/08 endpoints include the extent ID (as extent_id), by default the Python client strips it out when it creates the final GeoDataFrame. There is an option to keep the extend ID by setting the “keep_id” argument in the atl03/06/08 group of Python functions to True. This is useful when performing merges on GeoDataFrames from multiple APIs (for example, you can combine results from atl06 and atl08 endpoints and created a single GeoDataFrame with both elevation and vegatation data in it). Result times returned by SlideRule for legacy endpoints are in standard Unix nanoseconds, while times provided in the ICESat-2 standard data products are in seconds from the ATLAS Epoch. The server-side code performs this conversion for you. But if you are using ICESat-2 products direction in addition to SlideRule results, and need to convert between them, you must first convert the unix time to standard GPS time, and then you need to subtract the number of seconds between the GPS epoch which is January 6, 2018 at midnight (1980-01-06T00:00:00.000000Z) and the ATLAS SDP epoch of January 1, 2018 at midnight (2018-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z). That number is 1198800018 seconds. A.1 Segmented Photon Data - atl03sp The photon data is stored as along-track segments inside the ATL03 granules, which is then broken apart by SlideRule and re-segmented according to processing parameters supplied at the time of the request. The new segments are called extents. When the length of an extent is 40 meters, and the step size is 20 meters, the extent matches the ATL06 segments. Most of the time, the photon extents are kept internal to SlideRule and not returned to the user. But there are some APIs that do return raw photon extents for the user to process on their own. Even though this offloads processing on the server, the API calls can take longer since more data needs to be returned to the user, which can bottleneck over the network.",

      "content": "ICESat-2 Module ICESat-2 Module The ICESat-2 module within SlideRule supports a number of both legacy p-series and s-series endpoints, as well as the newer DataFrame-based x-series endpoints. This document focuses on the x-series endpoints while still referencing the other legacy endpoints when helpful. Three main kinds of data are returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints: segmented photon data, elevation data (from the ATL06-SR algorithm), and vegetation data (from the PhoREAL algorithm). All data returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints are organized around the concept of an extent. An extent is a variable length, customized ATL03 segment. It takes the ATL03 photons and divides them up based on their along-track distance, filters them, and then packages them together a single new custom segment. Given that the ICESat-2 standard data products have a well defined meaning for segment, SlideRule uses the term extent to indicate this custom-length and custom-filtered segment of photons. The following processing flags are used for all ICESat-2 endpoints: 0x0001: Along track spread too short 0x0002: Too few photons 0x0004: Maximum iterations reached 0x0008: Out of bounds 0x0010: Underflow 0x0020: Overflow In addition, most endpoints support the generation of a name filter using the granule parameter: rgt: Reference ground track cycle: Orbit cycle region: ATL03 region {1 to 14} version: ATL03 release version (e.g. 007) 1. ATL03 - atl03x The SlideRule atl03x endpoint provides a service for ATL03 custom processing. This endpoint queries ATL03 input granules for photon heights and locations based on a set of photon-input parameters that select geographic and temporal ranges. It then selects a subset of these photons based on a set of photon classification parameters, and divides these selected photons into short along-track extents, each of which is suitable for generating a single height estimate.",

Ancillary data returned from the atl03x (as well as theatl03s and atl03sp) APIs are per-photon values that are read from the ATL03 granules. No processing is performed on the data read out of the ATL03 granule. The fields must come from either a per-photon variable (atl03_ph_fields), or a per-segment variable (atl03_geo_fields). The atl03_geo_fields, atl03_ph_fields, and atl08_fields are used to specify additional fields in the ATL03 and ATL08 granules to be returned with the photon extent and dowstream customized products. Each field provided by the user will result in a corresponding column added to the returned GeoDataFrame. Note: if a field is requested that is already present in the default GeoDataFrame, then the name of both fields will be changed to include a _x suffix for the default incusion of the field, and a _y for the ancillary inclusion of the field.

If a user manually specifies that unclassified photons are to be included, the value used for an ancillary field for that photon has all 1’s in the binary encoding of that value. For example, if it is an 8-bit unsigned integer, the value would be 255. If it is a double-precision floating point, the value would be -nan. Since the ATL08 APIs return per-extent values and not per-photon values, the set of per-photon ancillary field values must be reduced in some way to a single per-extent value to be returned back to the user. There are currently two options available for how this reduction occurs. Nearest Neighbor (Mode): the value that appears most often in the extent is selected. This is the default method. For example, if a user specifies `atl08_fields”: [“asr”]`` in their parameters, and the PhoREAL extent consists of mostly two-thirds of one ATL08 segment, and a third of the next ATL08 segment (and if the photons rate is consistent across those two ATL08 segments), then the value returned by the nearest neighbor processing will be the ATL08 land_segment value from the first ATL08 segment. Interpolation (Average): the value that is the average of all the per-photon values provided. This is only performed when the user appends a “%” to the end of the field’s name in the field list parameter.",

      "content": "While all data returned from SlideRule for ATL03/06/08 endpoints include the extent ID (as extent_id), by default the Python client strips it out when it creates the final GeoDataFrame. There is an option to keep the extend ID by setting the “keep_id” argument in the atl03/06/08 group of Python functions to True. This is useful when performing merges on GeoDataFrames from multiple APIs (for example, you can combine results from atl06 and atl08 endpoints and created a single GeoDataFrame with both elevation and vegatation data in it). Result times returned by SlideRule for legacy endpoints are in standard Unix nanoseconds, while times provided in the ICESat-2 standard data products are in seconds from the ATLAS Epoch. The server-side code performs this conversion for you. But if you are using ICESat-2 products direction in addition to SlideRule results, and need to convert between them, you must first convert the unix time to standard GPS time, and then you need to subtract the number of seconds between the GPS epoch which is January 6, 2018 at midnight (1980-01-06T00:00:00.000000Z) and the ATLAS SDP epoch of January 1, 2018 at midnight (2018-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z). That number is 1198800018 seconds. A.1 Segmented Photon Data - atl03sp The photon data is stored as along-track segments inside the ATL03 granules, which is then broken apart by SlideRule and re-segmented according to processing parameters supplied at the time of the request. The new segments are called extents. When the length of an extent is 40 meters, and the step size is 20 meters, the extent matches the ATL06 segments. Most of the time, the photon extents are kept internal to SlideRule and not returned to the user. But there are some APIs that do return raw photon extents for the user to process on their own. Even though this offloads processing on the server, the API calls can take longer since more data needs to be returned to the user, which can bottleneck over the network.",

      "content": "ICESat-2 Module ICESat-2 Module The ICESat-2 module within SlideRule supports a number of both legacy p-series and s-series endpoints, as well as the newer DataFrame-based x-series endpoints. This document focuses on the x-series endpoints while still referencing the other legacy endpoints when helpful. Three main kinds of data are returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints: segmented photon data, elevation data (from the ATL06-SR algorithm), and vegetation data (from the PhoREAL algorithm). All data returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints are organized around the concept of an extent. An extent is a variable length, customized ATL03 segment. It takes the ATL03 photons and divides them up based on their along-track distance, filters them, and then packages them together a single new custom segment. Given that the ICESat-2 standard data products have a well defined meaning for segment, SlideRule uses the term extent to indicate this custom-length and custom-filtered segment of photons. The following processing flags are used for all ICESat-2 endpoints: 0x0001: Along track spread too short 0x0002: Too few photons 0x0004: Maximum iterations reached 0x0008: Out of bounds 0x0010: Underflow 0x0020: Overflow In addition, most endpoints support the generation of a name filter using the granule parameter: rgt: Reference ground track cycle: Orbit cycle region: ATL03 region {1 to 14} version: ATL03 release version (e.g. 007) 1. ATL03 - atl03x The SlideRule atl03x endpoint provides a service for ATL03 custom processing. This endpoint queries ATL03 input granules for photon heights and locations based on a set of photon-input parameters that select geographic and temporal ranges. It then selects a subset of these photons based on a set of photon classification parameters, and divides these selected photons into short along-track extents, each of which is suitable for generating a single height estimate.",

If res is less than len, subsequent segments will contain duplicate photons.

Ancillary data returned from the atl03x (as well as theatl03s and atl03sp) APIs are per-photon values that are read from the ATL03 granules. No processing is performed on the data read out of the ATL03 granule. The fields must come from either a per-photon variable (atl03_ph_fields), or a per-segment variable (atl03_geo_fields). The atl03_geo_fields, atl03_ph_fields, and atl08_fields are used to specify additional fields in the ATL03 and ATL08 granules to be returned with the photon extent and dowstream customized products. Each field provided by the user will result in a corresponding column added to the returned GeoDataFrame. Note: if a field is requested that is already present in the default GeoDataFrame, then the name of both fields will be changed to include a _x suffix for the default incusion of the field, and a _y for the ancillary inclusion of the field.

      "content": "The data goes through a series of processing steps before being returned back to the user as per-extent (i.e. variable-length segment) result values. When a user requests an ATL08 ancillary field, the ATL08 classifications are automatically enabled with all unclassified photons filtered out (i.e. noise, ground, canopy, and top of canopy are included; unclassified photons are excluded). If the user is also requesting PhoREAL processing, then noise photons are automatically filtered out as well. Lastly, if the user manually specifies which ATL08 photon classifications to use, then that manual specification takes precedence and is used. If a user manually specifies that unclassified photons are to be included, the value used for an ancillary field for that photon has all 1’s in the binary encoding of that value. For example, if it is an 8-bit unsigned integer, the value would be 255. If it is a double-precision floating point, the value would be -nan. Since the ATL08 APIs return per-extent values and not per-photon values, the set of per-photon ancillary field values must be reduced in some way to a single per-extent value to be returned back to the user. There are currently two options available for how this reduction occurs. Nearest Neighbor (Mode): the value that appears most often in the extent is selected. This is the default method. For example, if a user specifies `atl08_fields”: [“asr”]`` in their parameters, and the PhoREAL extent consists of mostly two-thirds of one ATL08 segment, and a third of the next ATL08 segment (and if the photons rate is consistent across those two ATL08 segments), then the value returned by the nearest neighbor processing will be the ATL08 land_segment value from the first ATL08 segment. Interpolation (Average): the value that is the average of all the per-photon values provided.

      "content": "While all data returned from SlideRule for ATL03/06/08 endpoints include the extent ID (as extent_id), by default the Python client strips it out when it creates the final GeoDataFrame. There is an option to keep the extend ID by setting the “keep_id” argument in the atl03/06/08 group of Python functions to True. This is useful when performing merges on GeoDataFrames from multiple APIs (for example, you can combine results from atl06 and atl08 endpoints and created a single GeoDataFrame with both elevation and vegatation data in it). Result times returned by SlideRule for legacy endpoints are in standard Unix nanoseconds, while times provided in the ICESat-2 standard data products are in seconds from the ATLAS Epoch. The server-side code performs this conversion for you. But if you are using ICESat-2 products direction in addition to SlideRule results, and need to convert between them, you must first convert the unix time to standard GPS time, and then you need to subtract the number of seconds between the GPS epoch which is January 6, 2018 at midnight (1980-01-06T00:00:00.000000Z) and the ATLAS SDP epoch of January 1, 2018 at midnight (2018-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z). That number is 1198800018 seconds. A.1 Segmented Photon Data - atl03sp The photon data is stored as along-track segments inside the ATL03 granules, which is then broken apart by SlideRule and re-segmented according to processing parameters supplied at the time of the request. The new segments are called extents. When the length of an extent is 40 meters, and the step size is 20 meters, the extent matches the ATL06 segments. Most of the time, the photon extents are kept internal to SlideRule and not returned to the user. But there are some APIs that do return raw photon extents for the user to process on their own. Even though this offloads processing on the server, the API calls can take longer since more data needs to be returned to the user, which can bottleneck over the network.",

These APIs were made public in early 2025 starting with version 4.11.0, and have a common methodology for processing the data which makes interfacing to them consistent across multiple datasets. Much of the functionality described here is duplicated in older-style p-series and s-series APIs described elsewhere. While the older-style APIs will continue to be supported, most of the new development effort is focused on these new DataFrame centric APIs. DataFrame APIs are accessed via the following sliderule function and always produce a GeoDataFrame: gdf = sliderule.run(api, parms, aoi=None, resources=None) where: api is a string that specifies which SlideRule API is being called parms is the request parameter dictionary aoi is the polygon defining the area of interest (provided for convenience only; if not supplied, the area of interest is taken directly from parms) resources is the list of granules to process (provided for convenience only; if not supplied, the resources are taken directly from parms) The columns in the returned GeoDataFrame depend on the contents of the parms structure passed to the api. Typically, there are a base set of columns defined for each api. If algorithms are specified in the parms, then the columns may be completely different depending upon the output of the algorithms. If ancillary fields or raster samplers are specified, then there may be additional columns. Metadata returned with the results of the API is placed in the attrs attribute of the GeoDataFrame.",

      "content": "ICESat-2 Module ICESat-2 Module The ICESat-2 module within SlideRule supports a number of both legacy p-series and s-series endpoints, as well as the newer DataFrame-based x-series endpoints. This document focuses on the x-series endpoints while still referencing the other legacy endpoints when helpful. Three main kinds of data are returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints: segmented photon data, elevation data (from the ATL06-SR algorithm), and vegetation data (from the PhoREAL algorithm). All data returned by the ICESat-2 endpoints are organized around the concept of an extent. An extent is a variable length, customized ATL03 segment. It takes the ATL03 photons and divides them up based on their along-track distance, filters them, and then packages them together a single new custom segment. Given that the ICESat-2 standard data products have a well defined meaning for segment, SlideRule uses the term extent to indicate this custom-length and custom-filtered segment of photons. The following processing flags are used for all ICESat-2 endpoints: 0x0001: Along track spread too short 0x0002: Too few photons 0x0004: Maximum iterations reached 0x0008: Out of bounds 0x0010: Underflow 0x0020: Overflow In addition, most endpoints support the generation of a name filter using the granule parameter: rgt: Reference ground track cycle: Orbit cycle region: ATL03 region {1 to 14} version: ATL03 release version (e.g. 007) 1. ATL03 - atl03x The SlideRule atl03x endpoint provides a service for ATL03 custom processing. This endpoint queries ATL03 input granules for photon heights and locations based on a set of photon-input parameters that select geographic and temporal ranges. It then selects a subset of these photons based on a set of photon classification parameters, and divides these selected photons into short along-track extents, each of which is suitable for generating a single height estimate.",

In order to correlate ATL24 classifications to ATL03, a release of ATL03 must be selected that has a corresponding ATL24 release. 1.3 Photon-extent Parameters Selected photons are divided and aggregated using along-track samples (“extents”) with user-specified length. These extends may or may not align with the original 20-m segments of ATL03 photons. The len parameter specifies the length of each extent, and the _res_parameter specifies the distance between subsequent extent centers. If res is less than len, subsequent segments will contain duplicate photons. The API may also select photons based on their along-track distance, or based on the segment-id parameters in the ATL03 product (see the dist_in_seg parameter). len: length of each extent in meters res: step distance for successive extents in meters dist_in_seg: true|false flag indicating that the units of the len and res are in ATL03 segments (e.g. if true then a len=2 is exactly 2 ATL03 segments which is approximately 40 meters) Extents are optionally filtered based on the number of photons in each extent and the distribution of those photons.

Ancillary data returned from the atl03x (as well as theatl03s and atl03sp) APIs are per-photon values that are read from the ATL03 granules. No processing is performed on the data read out of the ATL03 granule. The fields must come from either a per-photon variable (atl03_ph_fields), or a per-segment variable (atl03_geo_fields). The atl03_geo_fields, atl03_ph_fields, and atl08_fields are used to specify additional fields in the ATL03 and ATL08 granules to be returned with the photon extent and dowstream customized products. Each field provided by the user will result in a corresponding column added to the returned GeoDataFrame. Note: if a field is requested that is already present in the default GeoDataFrame, then the name of both fields will be changed to include a _x suffix for the default incusion of the field, and a _y for the ancillary inclusion of the field. In general, they should have the same value, but in some cases the ancillary field goes through different processing steps and may possibly contain a different value.",

      "content": "The data goes through a series of processing steps before being returned back to the user as per-extent (i.e. variable-length segment) result values. When a user requests an ATL08 ancillary field, the ATL08 classifications are automatically enabled with all unclassified photons filtered out (i.e. noise, ground, canopy, and top of canopy are included; unclassified photons are excluded). If the user is also requesting PhoREAL processing, then noise photons are automatically filtered out as well. Lastly, if the user manually specifies which ATL08 photon classifications to use, then that manual specification takes precedence and is used. If a user manually specifies that unclassified photons are to be included, the value used for an ancillary field for that photon has all 1’s in the binary encoding of that value. For example, if it is an 8-bit unsigned integer, the value would be 255. If it is a double-precision floating point, the value would be -nan. Since the ATL08 APIs return per-extent values and not per-photon values, the set of per-photon ancillary field values must be reduced in some way to a single per-extent value to be returned back to the user. There are currently two options available for how this reduction occurs. Nearest Neighbor (Mode): the value that appears most often in the extent is selected. This is the default method. For example, if a user specifies `atl08_fields”: [“asr”]`` in their parameters, and the PhoREAL extent consists of mostly two-thirds of one ATL08 segment, and a third of the next ATL08 segment (and if the photons rate is consistent across those two ATL08 segments), then the value returned by the nearest neighbor processing will be the ATL08 land_segment value from the first ATL08 segment. Interpolation (Average): the value that is the average of all the per-photon values provided. This is only performed when the user appends a “%” to the end of the field’s name in the field list parameter.",

      "content": "While all data returned from SlideRule for ATL03/06/08 endpoints include the extent ID (as extent_id), by default the Python client strips it out when it creates the final GeoDataFrame. There is an option to keep the extend ID by setting the “keep_id” argument in the atl03/06/08 group of Python functions to True. This is useful when performing merges on GeoDataFrames from multiple APIs (for example, you can combine results from atl06 and atl08 endpoints and created a single GeoDataFrame with both elevation and vegatation data in it). Result times returned by SlideRule for legacy endpoints are in standard Unix nanoseconds, while times provided in the ICESat-2 standard data products are in seconds from the ATLAS Epoch. The server-side code performs this conversion for you. But if you are using ICESat-2 products direction in addition to SlideRule results, and need to convert between them, you must first convert the unix time to standard GPS time, and then you need to subtract the number of seconds between the GPS epoch which is January 6, 2018 at midnight (1980-01-06T00:00:00.000000Z) and the ATLAS SDP epoch of January 1, 2018 at midnight (2018-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z). That number is 1198800018 seconds. A.1 Segmented Photon Data - atl03sp The photon data is stored as along-track segments inside the ATL03 granules, which is then broken apart by SlideRule and re-segmented according to processing parameters supplied at the time of the request. The new segments are called extents. When the length of an extent is 40 meters, and the step size is 20 meters, the extent matches the ATL06 segments. Most of the time, the photon extents are kept internal to SlideRule and not returned to the user. But there are some APIs that do return raw photon extents for the user to process on their own. Even though this offloads processing on the server, the API calls can take longer since more data needs to be returned to the user, which can bottleneck over the network.",

      "content": "Raster Sampling Raster Sampling Overview SlideRule supports sampling raster data at points of interest and including those sampled values alongside its customized data products. For instance, when performing an ATL06-SR processing run (atl06p), the returned GeoDataFrame has a row for each calculated elevation; that row can also include values from different raster datasets that have been sampled at the geolocation of the calculated elevation. Note Raster data consists of 2-dimensional datasets that form a grid of square pixels, often called an image. A common format for storing raster data is TIFF. GeoTIFF is an extension to the TIFF format that embeds geospatial information into the TIFF file that ties the raster data to a geospatial reference. COGs are cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs that are internally optimized for access in the cloud. For more information see https://www.cogeo.org. In order to sample a raster dataset, SlideRule must first ascertain which individual raster files in the dataset intersect the point of interest, then obtain credentials to access the identified files, and then lastly, open up those files and read the necessary pixels to calculate the returned sample value. Unfortunately, most raster datasets are organized slightly differently and require a small amount of specialized code to perform the first step of determining which raster files need to be sampled. The second step of obtaining credentials also requires some specialized code, but since most of our datasets are in AWS and authenticated through NASA DAACs, most of the authentication code is generic. But even still, because of this, each raster dataset supported by SlideRule needs to be registered with SlideRule ahead of time and provided in what we call an Asset Directory. Parameters To request raster sampling, the samples parameter must be populated as a dictionary in the request. Each key in the dictionary is used to label the data returned for that raster in the returned DataFrame.",

The samples field is itself a dictionary of dictionaries, each describing a raster dataset that needs to be sampled for the given processing request. The example below specifies two raster datasets that need to be sampled: The mosaic and strips dictionary keys are provided by the user to identify the data returned back to the user in the GeoDataFrame - they can be anything the user wants as long as it unique. The asset dictionary keys are used to identify which asset in SlideRule’s asset directory is to be sampled. The dictionary keys that follow all control how the raster is to be sampled. SlideRule supports various algorithms for sampling rasters: NearestNeighbour, Bilinear, Cubic, CubicSpline, Lanczos, Average, Mode, and Gauss. These are the algorithms supplied by GDAL and exposed to users through the SlideRule APIs. In addition to these algorithms, SlideRule also provides the ability to calculate zonal statistics for a given geolocation: count (number of pixels), minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard deviation, and median absolute deviation. Lastly, depending on the dataset, SlideRule provides custom bands that can be derived using other bands in the raster file. For example, the HLS dataset (landsat-hls) provides the following three custom bands: “NDSI”, “NDVI”, “NDWI”. Prior to sampling a raster, SlideRule provides ways to select and filter which rasters are sampled in a dataset. These include filtering based on time, and file name pattern matching. Sample Results The output returned in the DataFrame can take two different forms depending on the nature of the data requested.

      "content": "When using the SlideRule Python client, the parameters are captured and provided by the user in a Python dictionary, and the dictionary is automatically serialized into a JSON structure by the client when making the request. For example, to set the confidence filter on an ATL03 subsetting request, the parameter structure needed by the endpoint can be passed into the sliderule.run() function as a dictionary, like so: sliderule.run(\"atl03x\", {\"cnf\":-1}, resources=[\"ATL03_20181019065445_03150111_007_01.h5\"]) Issue the Processing Request There are two general purpose routines provided in the SlideRule Python client for issuing processing requests. sliderule.sourceImplements the low-level protocol for making requests to SlideRule and processing the results. This can be used to issue a request to any SlideRule endpoint. sliderule.runImplements a standard SlideRule convention for making requests to SlideRule endpoints that return a dataframe. This uses the sliderule.source() routine. A user is always free to use one of the routines above for making requests to SlideRule, but many times it is more convenient to use one of the helper functions in the mission specific modules. For instance, when making processing requests for ICESat-2 data, the icesat2 module provides many routines that wrap calls to specific endpoints in an easy-to-use Python function. For instance, when making a request to the atl06p endpoint, a user should use the icesat2.atl06p() Python routine. General Request Parameters Resources All requests must provide some way for the server side code to know which resources to process. Typically, that is accomplished via specifying an area of interest or other query parameters; but sometimes it is necessary to manually specify which resources to process. When that is the case, there are a few parameters the user can use to do so: resources: a list of resources to process (e.g.",

The applicable parameters used to specify the polygon are: poly: polygon of region of interest proj: projection used when subsetting data (“north_polar”, “south_polar”, “plate_carree”). In most cases, do not specify and code will do the right thing. ignore_poly_for_cmr: boolean for whether to use the polygon as a part of the request to CMR for obtaining the list of resources to process. By default the polygon is used and this is only here for unusual cases where SlideRule is able to handle a polygon for subsetting that CMR cannot, and the list of resources to process is obtained some other way. For example: region = [ {\"lon\": -108.3435200747503, \"lat\": 38.89102961045247}, {\"lon\": -107.7677425431139, \"lat\": 38.90611184543033}, {\"lon\": -107.7818591266989, \"lat\": 39.26613714985466}, {\"lon\": -108.3605610678553, \"lat\": 39.25086131372244}, {\"lon\": -108.3435200747503, \"lat\": 38.89102961045247} ] parms = { \"poly\": region['poly'] } In order to facilitate other formats, the sliderule.toregion function can be used to convert polygons from the GeoJSON and Shapefile formats into this format accepted by SlideRule. Rasterized Area of Interest There is no limit to the number of points in the polygon, but note that as the number of points grow, the amount of time it takes to perform the subsetting process also grows. Also, some regions cannot be expressed as a single polygon because they have holes in them or define discrete unconnected areas. Because of this, one of the outputs of the sliderule.toregion function is a GeoJSON object for describing complex geometries.",

The applicable parameters within the \"raster\" element used to specify this functionality are: geojson: geojson describing region of interest, enables use of rasterized region for subsetting cellsize: the resolution to rasterize the GeoJSON; currently the units are spherical degrees and no projections are supported, but support for projections will be included in future releases The example code below shows how this option can be enabled and used (note, the poly parameter is still required): region = sliderule.toregion('examples/grandmesa.geojson', cellsize=0.02) parms = { \"poly\": region['poly'], \"region_mask\": region['raster'] } Timeouts Each request supports setting three different timeouts. These timeouts should only need to be set by a user manually either when making extremely large processing requests, or when failing fast is necessary and default timeouts are too long. rqst_timeout: total time in seconds for request to be processed node_timeout: time in seconds for a single node to work on a distributed request (used for proxied requests) read_timeout: time in seconds for a single read of an asset to take timeout: global timeout setting that sets all timeouts at once (can be overridden by further specifying the other timeouts) Time A time range is typically used to limit the resources being processed to only include those resources collected within the time range specified.

When the ocean tide model yields an invalid ocean_tide value, the equilibrium tide is also set to invalid. Updated the description of ph_id_channel to read “Channel number assigned for each received photon event. This is part of the photon ID. Values range from 1 to 120 to span all channels and rise/fall edges. Values 1 to 60 are for falling edge; PCE1 (1 to 20), PCE2 (21 to 40), and PCE3 (41 to 60). Values 61 to 120 are for the rising edge; PCE1 (61 to 80), PCE2 (81 to 100), and PCE3 (101 to 120).” ATLAS housekeeping/status values from ATL02 were added to the /atlas_engineering group. The inland water mask was updated to an improved version. DEM height and flag were added to ATL03 at the 20m geolocation segment rate. The DEM height (found in /gtx/geophys_corr/dem_h) is the best available height from a collection of region-specific and global DEMs. The DEM flag (found in /gtx/geophys_corr/dem_flag) indicates which DEM the height is retrieved from (either ArcticDEM (1), GMTED (2), mean sea surface (3), or REMA (4)). Added a composite flag for POD/PPD quality at the 20m geolocation segment rate.",

The level of confidence of the reference photon determines how large of a threshold is used for this metric. Fixed a logic error in combining the POD and PPD degrade values (seen in /gtx/geolocation/podppd_flag). In doing this, the definition of the podppd_flag parameter was changed to simply indicate if POD, PPD, or both indicated a degraded solution. Effectively removed any photons from those telemetry bands that did not intersect (within a +-30m buffer) the reference DEM height from consideration by the signal classification processing. This results in fewer high cloud returns being classified as signal. In addition, those photons that are poorly geolocated are no longer classified as signal. Created a flag indicating where saturation of the ATLAS detectors likely occurs; the parameters on the product are the percentage of observed shots that are nearly or fully saturated within a geolocation segment. Added quality_ph, a per-photon indicator of possible saturated conditions and/or instrument related effects. This new parameter allows users to easily identify photons that are not likely true surface due to saturation conditions and/or internal reflections within the ATLAS instrument.",

Replaced GMTED2010 with the 3-arc-second MERIT DEM as the global DEM. The 3 arcsecond spatial resolution of the MERIT DEM is a marked improvement over the 7.5 arcsecond resolution of GMTED2010 and provides better terrain heights that compare more favorably to on-orbit data, particularly over forested regions and river basins. The MERIT DEM has improved absolute bias, striping and speckling noise compared to GMTED, and also an improved tree height bias. Changed geoid from the EGM2008 mean-tide system to the EGM2008 tide-free system. The prior EGM2008 geoid was provided in the mean-tide system that includes geoid deformation induced by the permanent tide. However, the ATL03 time-variant solid earth tides are computed in a tide- free system where the permanent tide is excluded. Changing the geoid on ATL03 from the EGM2008 mean- tide system to the tide-free system allows users to more easily re-reference photons heights above the geoid without additional corrections, bringing consistency to the tidal systems on ATL03. Added conversion factors for geoid and solid earth tide that allow easy conversion to/from tide-free/mean-tide systems. Adding these latitudinally-dependent conversion factors at the geolocation segment rate provides additional flexibility for users to convert between tide systems.",

Updated the reference photon selection algorithm to more accurately follow the logic described in the ATBD. Fixed the calculation and application of the neutral atmosphere delay derivative to non-reference photons in a geolocation segment. Improved TEP flagging to better identify TEP photons, and fixed TEP detection to function only in ATLAS spots 1 and 3. The improved TEP flagging captures more TEP photons, particularly in low signal cases. Improved the quality_ph flagging. Updated ATL03 photon heights to include time-dependent range bias. This is calculated with on-orbit data and better represents changes to the zero-range point over the mission. Added parameters for photon weights including weight_ph at the photon rate, knn at the 20 m geolocation segment rate, and win_h, win_x, and min_knn in the /ancillary_data/altimetry group. Updated sigma_h to be dynamically calculated as the sum of the ph_uncorrelated_error, the ATL03g-derived sigma_h, and 4 mm for geophysical correction uncertainties. Data type for ph_id_count was changed to an unsigned 1- byte integer. Updated ATL03 photon heights to include an updated zero range point. This includes updates to the time-of-flight calibration files and start time coefficients.",

      "content": "This measurement approach is fundamentally different from a full-waveform lidar system (such as the 1064-nm GLAS instrument on ICESat). The ATLAS instrument transmits green (532-nm) laser pulses at 10 kHz; the spacecraft velocity from the ICESat-2 nominal ~500- km frozen orbit altitude yields one transmitted laser pulse every ~0.7 meter along ground tracks. Each transmitted laser pulse is split by a diffractive optical element in ATLAS to generate six individual beams, arranged in three pairs (Figure 1-1). The beams within each pair have different transmit energies (‘weak’ and ‘strong,’ with an energy ratio between them of approximately 1:4) and are separated by 90 meters in the across-track direction. The beam pairs are separated by ~3.3 kilometers in the across-track direction, and the strong and weak beams are separated by ~2.5 kilometers in the along-track direction. Figure 1-1 shows the idealized beam and footprint pattern for ICESat-2. Figure 1-1. ATLAS Idealized Beam and Footprint Pattern. The left panel (Figure 1-1) shows the beam pattern for ICESat-2, while the right panel shows the instantaneous footprint pattern generated by each transmitted laser pulse from ATLAS. Light green circles indicate footprints from the relatively low energy (weak) beams, while the dark green circles indicate footprints from the relatively high-energy (strong) beams. As the -- 17 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 2 observatory moves in the along-track direction, the aggregation of overlapping footprints form a ground track on the Earth’s surface. Approximately 1014 photons begin the journey from ATLAS, travelling through the atmosphere to reflect off the Earth’s surface, return through the atmosphere and back into the ATLAS telescope.",

      "content": "For highly reflective surfaces and clear skies, on the order of ten signal photons from a single strong beam are expected to be recorded by ATLAS for a given transmit laser pulse. At the same time, background photons from sunlight at the same 532-nm wavelength may be arriving at the detector, and some of them will also be recorded by ATLAS. Any photon that ATLAS records an arrival time for is called a photon event, regardless of the source of the photon. The number of photon events recorded by ATLAS depends on the geometry and reflectance of the Earth’s surface, solar conditions, and on scattering and attenuation in the atmosphere. The number of returned photon events varies from near zero photon events per shot over very dark non- reflective surfaces, up to twelve photon events per shot over very reflective surfaces. In order to reduce the volume of data downlinked to Earth, ICESat-2 uses on-board flight software to identify and downlink data from those photon events most likely to represent returned photons from the laser pulse while also providing data on the atmospheric conditions. Given the 10-kHz laser pulse repetition rate, there are many transmitted laser pulses en route to and from Earth at any point in time. Transmitted laser pulses are separated in flight by ~30 kilometers in one-way travel. As such, there is an inherent height ambiguity of ~15 kilometers in received photon events. Consequently, ICESat-2 can only characterize the lowest ~15 kilometers of the Earth’s atmosphere. The on-board software counts photon events and generates a histogram spanning the lowest ~14 kilometers of the atmosphere with 30-m vertical bins. These atmospheric histograms aggregate the number of photon events over four hundred consecutive laser transmit pulses (an atmospheric histogram is generated every 0.04 seconds, spanning 280 meters of along-track distance). Atmospheric histograms are downlinked for the three strong ATLAS beams.",

      "content": "The volume and rate of photon events is large enough that ATLAS cannot assign unique time tags to every received photon event and downlink the relevant information. Instead, the flight software sets a range window of at least 500 meters and not more than 6,000 meters within which detected photons are time tagged and become photon events. The width of the window primarily depends on the surface type (e.g. ocean, land ice, land) as well as the topography (Leigh et al., 2014). Within the range window, ATLAS attaches time tags for received photons and generates altimetric histograms of these events. The on-board software uses these histograms to identify the surface and specify which photon event data are downlinked to Earth for each beam. The band of photon time tags downlinked to Earth is called the telemetry band. The width of the telemetry band of each beam is potentially different, and is described fully in the ATLAS Science Receiver Algorithm Description document. The ATL02 ATBD contains a description of how photon times of flight are calculated. The pointing vector and observatory position in space are described by the ATBDs for Precision Pointing Determination (PPD), and Precision Orbit Determination (POD), respectively. -- 18 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 3 While the lower-level data products typically work with individual photon events, higher-level geophysical data products work with aggregations of photons in order to determine the ellipsoidal height of the Earth, canopy height and structure, and other quantities of geophysical interest.

For example, photon event time tags are corrected for the effects of temperature and voltage variations on the ATLAS electronics, and biases are removed from timing and pointing measurements. The Precision Orbit Determination and Precision Pointing Determination use data from ATL02 to determine the position of the ICESat-2 observatory as a function of time and the pointing vector of the observatory as a function of time. ATL03 combines the data products of POD, PPD, and ATL02 to produce a Level 2 product containing geolocated ellipsoidal heights for each time tagged photon event downlinked from ATLAS. These heights are corrected for several geophysical phenomena (e.g. atmospheric refraction, tides) and are classified either as likely signal photon events or likely background photon events. Atmospheric data products draw the raw atmospheric profiles for each strong beam from ATL02. ATL04 provides normalized relative backscatter profiles and ATL09 produces calibrated backscatter profiles, atmospheric layer heights, and related atmospheric parameters. All Level 3A data products draw from the geolocated photon heights in ATL03 and the atmospheric parameters from ATL09.

The ATL03 product is the bridge between the lower level, instrumentation-specific products (ATL01/02) and the higher-level, surface- specific, science-centric products (ATL06 and above). By design, ATL03 provides a single source for all photon information needed by higher-level products (the corresponding atmospheric science Level-2 product ATL09 also feeds all the higher-level products; Figure 1-2). Each of the surface-specific, higher-level data products, such as land ice height or sea ice freeboard, will use the geolocated signal photon events and ancillary data provided in the ATL03 product. Consequently, ATL03 provides five surface masks (land ice, sea ice, ocean, land, and inland water) to reduce the volume of data that each surface-specific along-track data product is required to process.",

      "content": "In addition, ATL03 classifies each photon event as either a likely signal photon event or a background photon event and provides a confidence assessment on these classifications. This classification is made by generating histograms of the number of photon events as a function of height and calculating the signal-to-noise ratio of each histogram bin. Those photon events in bins with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than a threshold are classified as signal, while other photon events are classified as background. ATL03 applies multiple geophysical corrections to provide corrected heights for all the downlinked photon events. Additionally, ATL03 also supplies certain geophysical corrections as reference values to be applied at the end users’ discretion (i.e., geoid, ocean tides, dynamic atmospheric correction). These corrections include the effects of the atmosphere, as well as tides and solid earth deformation. By design, each of the corrections applied to the photon cloud can easily be removed by the end user from the ATL03 data products if desired. By default, they are applied to generate a best estimate of the photon height. Lastly, ATL03 provides all other spacecraft or instrument information needed by the higher-level data products. For example, the algorithms for sea ice height and ocean height require some knowledge of the ATLAS transmitted pulse shape or the ATLAS impulse-response function. While not explicitly needed to generate the ATL03 data product, the parameters are included in the ATL03 product files to provide a single source for all subsequent data products. ATL03 uses the product from ATL02 and the POD and PPD processes to create its output. The surface masks and geophysical corrections require a number of models and data products that have been assembled with the participation of the science community.

ATL03 and subsequent data products contain only those data where the use_flag indicates normal science data. In some cases, this will cause an entire ATL03 granule to be skipped; in other cases, only a portion of an ATL03 granule is skipped. In the case of a fully-skipped ATL03, ATL02 is the final data product produced. The SIPS data processing generates an empty ATL03 file in these cases: the metadata and orbit related parameters are correct, but the granule contains no photon-rate data. Strictly speaking, ATL03 is generated only for those periods where ATLAS is in normal science mode and laser transmit time information is available in these same periods of time. Additionally, ATL03 is generated only when all necessary pieces (ATL02, POD, PPD, and related ANC files) are available, and if there are at least 1000 photons present per beam to avoid processing problems. If any of these are missing, ATL03 and higher-level products are not generated. Also note that this data flow only applies to non-transmitter echo pulse (TEP) photon events: TEP photon events are stored in their own group on the ATL02 data product. When ATL03 is generated, Figure 2‑1 provides a high-level overview of the major elements of the data flow for received photon events to produce the ATL03 data product. The ICESat-2 geolocation along-track segment boundaries (sometimes called the ICESat-2 grid, ICESat-2 Geolocation segments, or geosegs) are described in section 3.1. This section defines a grid of points aligned with each of the 1,387 reference ground tracks (RGT) of the ICESat-2 mission.

The POD ATBD describes the algorithms used to determine the position of the center of mass of the observatory as a function of time. The primary inputs to ATL03g (functionally collected in the dashed red box in Figure 2-1) are the photon time of flight from ATL02 for each telemetered photon event, the pointing vector from PPD and the position of the observatory center of mass from POD. ATL03g uses these inputs and determines a preliminary latitude, longitude, and height above the ellipsoid for each photon in steps 1 through 7 in section 3.1 of the ATL03g document. In addition, ATL03g estimates the range bias for each beam, which is stored for additional analysis. The range bias estimates are used to potentially update the beam-specific time of flight biases applied in ATL02. ATL03g also estimates the pointing angle biases for each beam.

The most important is the location of the top of the telemetry bands. The telemetry band tops and widths can change every two hundred shots (often called the major frame rate) and is useful to several subsequent steps in ATL03 and higher-level products. Consequently, the range to the top of the telemetry band is treated just like a received photon event and is geolocated along with the rest of the photon events.

The resulting surface types and preliminary ellipsoidal heights are then passed to the signal- finding algorithm described in section 5.0. The main outputs of this algorithm are a classification for all photon events between likely background photon events and likely signal photon events (with low, medium, and high confidence). The resulting photon event classifications are then stored. All photon events are assigned to one of the ICESat-2 geolocation along-track segments following the process described in section 3.1. The goal of this step is to discretize the cloud of photon events into a coarser group to facilitate the final geolocation step. After the photons are grouped into these segments, a reference photon for each along-track segment is identified in section 3.2. These are drawn from the signal photons (if any are present) following a hierarchical process. While the step of assigning photon events to a specific segment can be done in parallel with the photon event classification, section 3.2, Selecting the Reference Photon, requires the output from both section 3.1, The ICESat-2 Geolocation Along-Track Segments, and section 5.0, Photon Classification. We use the latitude and longitude of the reference photon to determine surface type at the geolocation segment rate (20 m along-track).

Section 4.0 describes the surface masks used to assign each photon to one or more surface types. ATL03 defines five surface types (land, ocean, sea ice, land ice, and inland water) that collectively cover the surface of the Earth. This designation provides guidance to some aspects of the photon classification algorithm (section 5.0) and guides high-level data products to the ATL03 data of interest. There is an overlap of approximately ten kilometers between adjacent surface classifications, and therefore some regions on the Earth have multiple surface classifications. For example, areas along the edges of the Arctic Ocean are classified as ocean, sea ice, and land. Section 5.0 describes the photon classification algorithm. This algorithm classifies each geolocated photon event as being a likely signal photon event or a background photon event. This designation can be used by higher-level data products to further reduce the data volume considered by that algorithm. The guiding philosophy of the photon classification algorithm is to avoid false negatives (i.e. signal photon events misclassified as background) at the expense of including false positives (i.e. background photon events misclassified as signal). This classification algorithm also generates a parameter to identify the degree of confidence in designating a particular photon event as signal or background.

The database requires the full RGT and interpolation times for each reference track (found in ANC22, see POD Facility ICD) to allow 20 m segment endpoints to be computed for each RGT. ANC22 is generated once, prior to launch, and is used to assign each received photon event to a segment, even if ATLAS is pointed away from the RGT (e.g. pointing at targets of opportunity or off-pointing in the mid-latitudes). The RGT file (ANC22) contains ECF cartesian coordinate positions located on the WGS-84 ellipsoid every 1 second that define each of the 1387 ICESat-2 reference tracks. Therefore, the file contains ECF X, Y, Z at 1Hz. Time is not stored because each point is 1 sec from the previous point. All points have an associated reference track id number (0-1387). For every ascending node (AN) crossing, the reference track id number increments by 1. The first data point begins at 0 before the RGT has begun, just before the 1st AN. The interpolation time vector for a given reference track is formed using start and stop times in addition to a delta time variable for each reference track in the RGT. This interpolation vector allows the 20 m segment endpoints to be quickly computed for any track. The start and stop time for each track in the RGT has both integer and fractional seconds relative to the 0 second point in the RGT. Therefore, these times provide the data necessary to interpolate the RGT data to get the ECF cartesian positions of the start and stop of each reference track.",

Load up one data point (ECF position) before the first (before AN) position and one data point after the last (past next AN) position. 2.

This time step needs to be adjusted to create an integer number of segments between the reference track’s start and stop time. The reference track start time, stop time, and delta time are then stored for the ith track. The delta time step along with the start and stop times produces an interpolating time vector for each track that enables the computation of ~20 m segments with cm variation.

However, in order to correctly geolocate the non-reference photons, the geolocation segment of each photon must be established.

Compute distance between BP j and 1 Hz reference track positions and select 20 m segment endpoints (Fig. 3.1) 2.1. Photon bounce point geodetic spherical coordinates latitude, longitude and height (𝜙, 𝜆, ℎ) are converted into ECF coordinates that have topography removed (h=0) and are located on the same reference ellipsoid as the RGT (WGS-84). Define distance N: 𝑁 = 𝑎𝑒 1−𝑒2 sin 𝜙 sin 𝜙 Where 𝑎𝑒and 𝑒2 are the Earth’s semi-major axis and eccentricity squared respectively.

Initially, the general location on the reference track, which is closest to the bounce point, is determined using the 1 Hz positions. The coordinate with the smallest computed absolute distance and its immediate neighboring points (for a total of 3) cover a spatial distance of approximately 15-16 km and are approximately a straight line along the reference ellipsoid. 2.3. All 20 m segment endpoint positions with a time stamp within or equal to 1 sec of the closest 1 Hz position are selected for further computations. See Figure 3.1. 2.4. The BP and selected 20 m endpoint positions are used to calculate the distance between them. The closest three endpoints contain the closest two geo-segments to the BP. The closest segment is first selected to check if it contains the BP. 2.5.

Special cases 4.1. The assumption that the reference track search area (step 2.2) is a straight-line is only approximate. Neighboring segments share approximately the same boundary wall (see Figure 3-3), but every wall is calculated independently for each segment and no constraints are enforced. Analysis shows that all geo-segment boundary walls are less than 1” (arcsecond) offset. So there exist a few cases where a BP may not be assigned a geo- segment (90o ≤ θ ≤ 90o+1”) and another case where a BP could be assigned to two segments (90o-1” ≤ θ ≤ 90o”). If this happens then additional computations are needed. 4.2. θ is calculated for the next closest segment and the segment with the smallest value that also meets the condition θ < 90o+1” is assigned the BP. 4.3. A message is printed so the user knows that the additional computation was necessary, or in the case no segment is assigned to the BP. 4.4. The result is an assignment for every photon to exactly one geo-segment bin. 5. Other output parameters Two other output parameters are generated at this step. The segment_ID parameter is a seven digit number that uniquely identifies each along track segment, and is written to the /gtx/geolocation/ group at the along-track geolocation segment rate (i.e. ~20 m along track). The four digit RGT number can be combined with the seven digit segment_ID number to uniquely define any along-track segment number.",

Once a set of candidate photons are identified, one photon is selected from the set as the reference photon (3.2.5 Reference Photon Selection). The reference photon selection process terminates once a reference photon has been selected.

For each reference photon, the algorithm determines the index of the reference photon, and stores it as reference_photon_index in the /gtx/geolocation/ group. This index is a shortcut that identifies the jth reference photon within the n photons on a particular ATL03 granule. Similarly, the algorithm identifies the index of the first photon in the along-track geolocation segment and stores its value as ph_index_beg in the same group.

Therefore, careful consideration is needed to evaluate and quantify potential sources of measurement bias (time of flight bias, or range bias), and account for the bias in the ATL03 photon heights. In addition, we evaluate the uncertainty in that bias, and determine both the bias and the bias uncertainty. In this section, we present the logic and data flows used to determine the likely sources of bias and bias uncertainty, as well as the concept to evaluate the range bias using on-orbit data after launch.",

The pointing direction of each beam is determined by the Precision Pointing Determination (PPD) algorithm, using primarily data from the Laser Reference System (LRS) on ATLAS. Each beam shares a common origination point at the ATLAS diffractive optical element (DOE), where the single laser beam from the active ATLAS laser is split into the 6 beams: 3 weak and 3 strong. The location of the DOE was measured in the ICESat-2 Master Reference Frame (MRF), which provided a common frame for the relative locations of the components of ATLAS (such as the DOE) and the ICESat-2 Observatory (such as the observatory center of mass). The schematic of the measurement is outlined in Figure 3-4. The zero-range distance of ATLAS was measured before launch during integration and test to account for the optical and electrical path lengths within ATLAS. Essentially, the zero-range distance measurement consisted of comparing the ATLAS-measured range to a target at an independently measured series of distances from ATLAS, and solving for the apparent distance to a target placed at “zero range”, or right in front of ATLAS. These distances were measured for many permutations of ATLAS settings and configurations (e.g. primary and redundant detectors, primary and redundant start pulse detectors, etc…) and are documented in the ATLAS pre-launch calibration product CAL-08. The zero-range distances are shown schematically as the lengths of the green vectors in Figure 3-4.",

In releases 001-004, the ATL03 product used the uncorrected beam-specific ZRP from the June 2017 CAL-08 product. The transmitter echo path (TEP; see Section 7.2.2 for a complete description) provides a post- launch means to internally calibrate changes in the ATLAS range by selecting a small fraction of the outgoing laser light and optically routing that light into the ATLAS detectors. By observing changes in the time of flight (tof) of photons following the TEP optical path, we can characterize changes in the internal ATLAS range bias on-orbit. This TEP-based range correction (orange vectors in Figure 3-4) varies over the mission duration, and can be added to the uncorrected zero range points (green dots in Figure 3-4) along the beam directions to determine the corrected zero range points (orange dots in Figure 3-4). Note that the TEP-based range correction can either be a positive or negative. These changes are primarily due to thermal changes within the instrument, but will also account for any ageing or long-term changes. In release 005 and later, the ATL03 reported height (h_ph) includes the TEP-based range correction. ATL02 provides surface-return times of flight for all detected photons in the telemetry window and TEP tof for likely TEP photons. The two times of flight are in distinct groups on the ATL02 data product. In post-launch operations, the surface return times of flight are passed from ATL02 to the geolocation algorithm (ATL03g), converted to range, and then eventually to photon height.",

The ISF uses the TEP photons, and changes in their time of flight, to generate the TEP-based range bias offset in meters that are applied to h_ph starting in rel005. We note that not every ATL02 granule will have likely TEP photons, as described in Section 7.2.2. Whenever such TEP photons are likely present, these corrections for the two beams with the TEP optical path are passed from the ISF to the POD/PPD facility via ANC13. These TEP-based corrections are based on a comparison of pre-launch sets of TEP data under the relevant instrument configuration with those collected on-orbit. Because TEP data only exist for ATLAS spots 1 and 3, pre-launch testing data is used to map the offsets computed for the TEP spots to the non-TEP spots (2, 4, 5, and 6) spot-specific range biases. The full details are provided in the Computation of the ICESat-2 Range Vector document, available upon request. We include the inherent uncertainty in this time-dependent range bias correction in the overall photon height uncertainty (sigma_h). When one or more threshold crossing times from the Start Pulse Detector is missing, an additional time of flight error must be accounted for. Correcting for this additional bias requires use of the Start Pulse Coefficient Table (which is nominally updated only when the laser transmit energy changes and/or the threshold crossing levels are changed) and the time of flight flag parameter (TOF_flag) from ATL02. The Start Pulse Coefficient Table is routinely provided by the ISF to the POD/PPD facility via ANC13. The TOF_flag parameter is generated at the photon rate and identifies the scenario (i.e. nominal is all threshold crossings present, and the other cases correspond to one or more missing start pulse components). The details of computing the start pulse coefficients can be found in the ATL02 ATBD, section 3.4.5.",

      "content": "This term is driven by the uncertainty in determining the centroid of a realization of TEP photons, largely due to the transmit pulse shape variations and photon statistics, and the uncertainty in the relationship between the bias of the TEP-monitored spots and the other non-TEP monitored spots. We expect this term to be very small (~10 picoseconds). (b) uncertainty in the model for how the TEP varies around an orbit, bias. This model will be based on data collected during commissioning and will be re-evaluated periodically during the mission. The purpose of this model is to estimate the variation of the range bias for each beam between realizations of the TEP in the ATL02 data. This term captures the model uncertainties in predicting the range bias for each beam. When the TEP is available, we expect the model uncertainty for the two beams with the TEP to be zero. (c) uncertainty in the atmospheric delay correction, atm. The atmospheric delay (combining wet and dry tropospheric effects) is described in ATL03a. This range correction is based on imperfect atmospheric models of temperature and humidity and has a residual error that is determined in the ATL03a processing. From a data flow standpoint, the ISF produces TEP for each realization of the TEP along with the TEP-based bias correction. The POD/PPD facility generates bias for each beam at the same rate as the model-based range bias correction. This is passed along with ANC04 to the SIPS. The third term (atm) is generated during ATL03a processing and is combined in quadrature with the other two terms during geolocation processing to produce a single height uncertainty estimate. This estimate is provided at the along-track geolocation segment rate and contributes to the overall sigma_h, the theoretical total height uncertainty of a given reference photon.",

The value for sigma_h is calculated as the sum of the uncorrelated error and correlated error. The uncorrelated error is as described in Section 7.7.2.

      "content": "These TEP measurements were turned into a time series of range bias by the ISF and provided to the POD group. These TEP-based variations in range bias were correlated to the orbit angle and beta prime and created an updated model for the variation of the range bias of the strong beams with the TEP. In addition, we will aggregate 10 days of ATL03 data, during nominal operating conditions and excise short latency (< 24 hours) cross-over data between ascending and descending tracks. By using the likely signal photons (described in Section 5), comparisons are made of the elevations measured between the ascending and descending passes over a given cross over for each of the six beams. The residual height differences between the two strong beams monitored by the TEP are considered the true height residual. Using the variation from the TEP-monitored beams, we will update the range-bias correction model for the other non-TEP monitored beams by simultaneously solving for all model parameters for each of the 6 beams. By comparing the model predictions of the TEP-monitored beams, with the measurements of the cross over residuals of these beams, we will iteratively update the model parameters to drive the height residuals toward zero. This process will be repeated any time the laser or detector side is changed from the primary to the redundant side. The effectiveness of this approach depends on understanding how range bias variations in the TEP-monitored beams translate to the non-TEP monitored beams from pre-launch calibration activities. This analysis will be done in the POD/PPD facility, using final ATL03 data. Provided that an improved range-bias correction model can be generated, the new model will be reviewed and implemented during re-processing and will result in a new version of ATL03, with improved range-bias corrections.",

Schematic of nominal zero range distance and TEP-based correction for zero range measurement. 3.4 Other Geolocated Parameters In addition to the telemetered photon data, other parameters are treated as though they are photons in order to calculate their ellipsoidal height. In order to generate histograms and related statistics of the telemetered photon data, the signal finding algorithm in section 5 requires the ellipsoidal height of the top of the telemetered bands of photons as well as the widths of the telemetered bands. Therefore, the tops of the telemetry bands will also be geolocated to determine the latitude, longitude, and heights associated with each band. The heights of each geolocated telemetry band and its width are required for the signal finding algorithm (section 5) to assure all histogram bins are fully within the telemetry bands. In addition, the latitude and longitude of the telemetry bands are used to query the surface masks described in section 4 to determine the surface types traversed by a given granule. The relevant parameters from ATL02 to derive the ellipsoidal height of the telemetry bands are the sum of the range window start (alt_rw_start) and the downlink band offset (alt_band_offset1(2) in the /pacx/altimetry/ group on ATL02 for strong and weak beams) for each beam. This will provide the delay, in seconds, to the start of the telemetry bands for all received photons in a given major frame. The range to the top of the telemetry band is determined by multiplying that delay by the speed of light divided by two. This range is then geolocated per ATL03g as are all other telemetered photon data.",

As described in section 7.3, the lower rate data has duplicate values in order to post all parameters in this group at 200 Hz. At times, it may be necessary to know or use the ground bounce time of the reference photon. ATL03 provides the bounce_time_offset parameter in the /gtx/geolocation group. The bounce_time_offset is the difference between the transmit time and the ground bounce time of a reference photon. It is calculated from the delta_time array in the /gtx/geolocation group (which provides the transmit time of the reference photon, measured in seconds from the atlas_sdp_gps_epoch), the absolute time reference for a given granule, and the absolute bounce point time (tB(i); from ATL03g Eq. 3.1.4) of the reference photon, as: bounce_time_offset = bounce_point_time – (delta_time + atlas_sdp_gps_epoch) This formulation assumes that the elapsed time from the observatory to the ground is identical to the elapsed time from the ground to the observatory. The value of bounce_time_offset is always positive. The ATL03g geolocation algorithm uses this approximation (see ATL03g, Section 3.1 and Section 3.6). All other parameters in the ATL03 data product generated by the geolocation process are listed in Appendix A (data product group: /gtx/geolocation; posted at the along-track segment rate of approximately twenty meters) and are described in ATL03a and ATL03g. The uncertainty in horizontal geolocation (sigma_along and sigma_across) are set to static values of 5 meters in ATL03 release 006. Similarly, sigma_lat (0.000063 degrees) and sigma_lon (7 m / ( (111,000 m/deg) * cos(ph_lat deg)) are static values in the initial ATL03 releases. These will become dynamically computed during the geolocation process in future releases of ATL03.",

For example, the land ice surface mask directs the ATL06 land ice algorithm to consider data from only those areas of interest to the land ice community. In order to protect against errors of omission in these masks, a buffer has been added to the best estimate of the geographic bounds of the regions of interest. Consequently, the grids do not perfectly tessellate the surface of the Earth but have overlap on the order of tens of kilometers in most regions. This means that a given latitude and longitude point could appear in two or more surface masks, and two or more higher-level data products. Differences among the algorithms used by higher-level data products for a multiply-classified granule of ATL03 are expected. For example, many permafrost areas are included in the land, land ice, and inland water masks and will be included in the associated ATL08, ATL06, and ATL13 data products, although they will all take as input the same ATL03 granule. The masks are provided to the SIPS as text files of latitude, longitude, and a flag (=1 if the grid node contains the surface of interest), and are stored and accessed by SIPS as ANC12-01. The exception is the inland water mask, which is provided as a .tif file, and is stored and accessed by SIPS as ANC12-02. These grids are under configuration management (CM) control and the relevant document numbers are provided. For each surface type, the technical details and code used to generate the grid are also under CM control and the relevant document numbers are provided. To the extent possible, the input data used are also under CM control.",

      "content": "As described above and in section 5.1.4.1.2, the surface type is determined at the major frame rate, or at 50 Hz. We recommend using the latitude and longitude of the geolocated top of the telemetry band as the basis for querying the surface type masks described below. On the output ATL03 data product, the surf_type parameter is posted at the along-track segment rate at reference photon locations. In order to map from one to the other, we use inclusive resampling, where the value at the reference photon location is the combination of values at the major frame locations before and after the reference photon location. If either end point indicates a particular type (i.e. type=sea ice == true), then the value at the reference photon location is that type as well. When no telemetry band is downlinked from the observatory, the surf_type array will consist only of false values (i.e. 0s) indicating that no data was telemetered for that major frame. 4.2 Land Ice The ATL03 land ice mask is a 0.05°x0.05° logical mask that is used to isolate records to be processed using the land ice algorithms.

Any tile with ellipsoidal height ≤0 was flagged as water and any tile with ellipsoidal height ≥0 was flagged as land. Step 2: The MOD44W water mask was read in tile by tile. For every pixel with valid latitude, longitude, and flag, if the flag indicated water, the corresponding tile in the 0.05°x0.05° water mask was set. Similarly, for every pixel with valid latitude, longitude and flag, if the flag indicated land, the corresponding tile in the 0.05°x0.05° land mask was set.",

Latitude and longitude were calculated using software provided by Nicolo DiGirolamo. Step 4: The full-resolution GSHHG shoreline was converted to a land mask with a resolution of 0.05°x0.05°. Its inverse was used as a GSHHG water mask. Step 5: The masks from the three sources were combined to generate the composite water and land masks. For the water mask, any tile that was flagged in the MOD44W or IBCAO water mask, or not flagged in the GSHHG land mask, was flagged in the composite mask. For the land mask, any tile that was not flagged in the MOD44W or IBCAO, or was flagged in the GSHHG land mask, was flagged in the composite mask. Step 6: The MOD44W water mask includes inland water. To remove it, a shrunken version of the GSHHG land mask was generated by unflagging any tiles along a 10-km wide strip around each GSHHG polygon. Any tiles flagged in this shrunken mask were unflagged in the water mask to make the ocean mask. Step 7: Per the request of the ATL12 data product lead (Jamie Morison), a 10-km buffer was added to the composite ocean mask (Figure 4-3), and all tiles north of 84°N were flagged.

Because the Antarctic mask was generated from polygons, the southern limit of the mask was set at 60°S, and because the northern tier mask was to include all land, and thus be defined by the GSHHG shorelines, the northern limit was set at 60°N. Thus the data that were buffered initially covered the MODIS granules from v=3 to v=14. The first pass through these data did not include row v=14. Instead of reprocessing all the data, this row was processed separately. The MOD44W water mask granules were read one at a time. Latitudes and longitudes were computed for the SW corner of all pixels using software provided by Nick DiGirolamo, and the appropriate pixels in a 0.01°x0.01° grid were flagged. If the input pixel extended across more than one output pixel, all appropriate output pixels were flagged.

At the ground, photons are scattered once, or many times, by surface interactions, such as with vegetation or snow and ice grains, and depart in every direction, including back towards ATLAS. Based on performance models, the arrival times of up to twelve received photons per transmitted laser pulse return to the ATLAS telescope’s focal plane and are recorded by the detector electronics. At the same time, background photons from sunlight are continually entering the telescope when the surface is illuminated by the sun, and the arrival times of these are also recorded. The number and distribution of the returned photons depends on the geometry and reflectance of the Earth’s surface, on scattering and attenuation in the atmosphere, and, for the background photons, on the solar angle. Any photon that is time tagged by ATLAS, regardless of source, is referred to as a photon event. Based on pre-launch test data, photon events due to instrument noise are a small fraction of time-tagged photons, and are indistinguishable from solar background photons. A primary objective of the ICESat-2 data processing is to correctly discriminate between signal photon events and background photon events. This is done as a series of three steps with progressively finer discrimination. First, onboard algorithms reduce the volume of data downlinked to the Earth by generating histograms and determining which histogram bins are most likely to contain the desired surface echo.",

      "content": "The downlinked band of photon events varies according to surface type, surface roughness, and the precision with which the surface is already known. For example, the ellipsoidal height of the ocean is known much more precisely than the ellipsoidal height of rough mountainous terrain. It is possible that there will be more than one downlinked band of photon events for a given along-track interval, for example if the on-board algorithm identifies two distinct bands of heights that may contain surface echoes. Second, ATL03 classifies each downlinked photon event as being either likely signal or background using two approaches: a histogramming method (Section 5.1), and a photon weighting method (Section 5.2). These algorithms are described in detail in this section. The goal of the histogramming photon classification is to reduce the volume of data that the subsequent higher-level data products must analyze. The goal of the photon weighting approach is to provide a metric of relative photon density. Finally, the surface-specific higher-level data products generate precise ellipsoidal heights from the identified signal photon events. These precise, surface-specific heights are used to satisfy the ultimate goals of the ICESat-2 mission. In saturated conditions, photons that are characteristic of ATLAS instrument effects and not likely true surface may be labeled as signal. The photon-rate parameter /gtx/heights/quality_ph identifies those photons which are likely due to instrument effects.

      "content": "The goal of this algorithm is to identify all the signal photon events while classifying as few as possible of the background photon events erroneously as signal. If the rate of background photon events is known, then the algorithm can identify likely signal photon events by finding regions where the photon event rate is significantly larger than the background photon event rate. The telemetry band is limited (30 meters to ~1500 meters), so the downlinked photon data is not optimal for calculating a robust background count rate. However, for atmospheric research, ICESat-2 telemeters histograms of the sums of all photons over four hundred laser transmit pulses (0.04 seconds; ~280 meters along-track) in 30-m vertical bins for ~14 kilometers in height that includes the atmosphere, surface echoes, and extends below the Earth’s surface. These histograms are referred to as atmospheric histograms. After removing the relatively few bins that may contain signal photon events from these atmospheric histograms, the algorithm uses the remaining bins to estimate the background photon event rate (section 5.1.4.1.1). Nominally, the atmospheric histograms will only be downlinked for the strong beams. When the atmospheric histogram is not available, the photon cloud itself is used to determine the background count rate. The algorithm uses the resulting background rate estimate to calculate a signal threshold. It then generates a histogram of photon ellipsoidal heights (heights above the WGS-84 ellipsoid) and distinguishes signal photons from background photons as those that pass a series of tests dependent on the signal threshold. Data from each ground track is considered independently for the ellipsoidal histogramming procedure. Over sloping surfaces, the surface photons can be spread over a range of heights so that they are not readily found with ellipsoidal histogramming.",

      "content": "To identify these, a histogram is generated relative to the surface profile as defined by the surrounding ellipsoidally-identified signal photon events. This procedure is referred to as slant histogramming. For the strong beams, if a large break in signal photons is still evident, there is an option to perform variable slope slant histogramming to find any remaining signal photon events. Since the signal to noise ratio is larger for the strong beam than the weak beam, the strong beam provides a better definition of the surface than the weak beam. The ground tracks of a strong and weak beam pair are essentially parallel to each other, and separated by ~90 meters in the across-track direction, so the slopes of the resultant surface profiles should be very similar. Therefore for the weak beam of each pair, the algorithm uses the surface profile found in the strong beam to guide slant histogramming in the weak beam. Authors of each of the higher-level surface-specific ICESat-2 ATBDs that draw on the ATL03 data product have provided guidance regarding the fidelity to which the ATL03 algorithm needs to discriminate signal and background photon events. In general, each higher-level data product requires ATL03 to identify likely signal photon events within +/- 10 meters of the surface. Since this algorithm uses histograms, the vertical resolution at which signal photons are selected is directly proportional to the histogram bin size. All photons in any one bin are either classified as -- 64 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 49 signal or background events. One of the goals of the algorithm is to use the smallest bin size for which signal can be found, to classify photons at the finest resolution possible. Our test cases show that this resolution in all but very weak signal conditions meets or exceeds the needs of the higher-level data products.",

      "content": "This smallest bin size varies as a function of surface slope and background count rate. Once identified, the algorithm generates a flag for each photon event indicating whether the algorithm determined a given photon event to be signal or background, as well as the parameters used to classify photons. As requested by the science team, additional photon events are flagged surrounding those selected as signal to ensure that the photon events classified as signal span a minimum of twenty meters vertically. The flag distinguishes between photon events that were added as a buffer and those that were identified as signal, and indicates the level of confidence in the classification. To prevent classifying clouds as signal in release 003 and later, only photons in telemetry bands intersecting the reference DEM height within a 30 m buffer (above the band top and below the band bottom) are considered by the signal classification algorithm. Ignoring telemetry bands outside the buffer also prevents classifying poorly geolocated photons as signal. The output parameters are defined in Table 5-4 and are indicated throughout this document in bold italics. Table 5-1, Table 5-2, and Table 5-3 respectively contain the input variables from external data sources, parameters used to drive the algorithm, and intermediate variables generated and used within the algorithm. 5.1.2 Overview This algorithm assumes that background photon events recorded by ATLAS follow a Poisson distribution, which has been supported by analysis of MABEL (the airborne ICESat-2 simulator; McGill et al. 2010; MABEL Background Count Rate Analysis supporting document) photon- counting data. Therefore, this algorithm uses Poisson statistics to find outliers to this distribution, which are designated as possible signal photon events. The algorithm makes this discrimination on the basis of histograms, where photon events are aggregated into along-track and vertical bins.",

      "content": "Background photon events are randomly distributed among the bins (according to Poisson statistics) while signal photons cluster into one or a few bins. The algorithm is driven by input parameters, many of which are surface type dependent, to optimize signal definition while minimizing execution time. Figure 5-1 shows photons from one MABEL green channel over the Greenland ice sheet during the daytime, with along-track distance on the x-axis and ellipsoidal height on the y-axis. The signal and noise levels in this example are similar to what we expect for the ATLAS strong beam. Each photon event is plotted as a point and because there are so many photon events from the surface, the surface appears as a thin black line. Variations in the background count rate are apparent; these are due to changing atmospheric conditions and surface reflectivity. Note that over sloping surfaces, the signal photon density decreases as the returns are spread out. -- 65 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 50 Figure 5-1. Example MABEL data collected near the edge of the Greenland ice sheet. April 2012, near local noon. This is one of several hundred granules used to develop and test the algorithm. Surface slopes present one of the main challenges for identifying signal photon events (e.g. Figure 5-1). Ideally, one would histogram the photon event heights relative to the direction of the slope of the surface so all the signal photons would be combined into one bin. However, the surface slope over the integration span is not known a priori. As a first step, the algorithm histograms the photon event heights relative to the ellipsoid. The algorithm steps through the data granule in uniform time increments, Δtime. For each Δtime, the algorithm histograms the photon events over an integration time, δt, at a vertical resolution, δz.",

      "content": "The algorithm automatically adjusts δt and δz (section 5.1.4.2.4) until the algorithm either identifies vertical bins that contain more photon events than a threshold based on the background count distribution, or the algorithm reaches a pre-defined limit on δt and δz (Table 5-2) without identifying any bins that contain signal photon events for a given Δtime. This automatic adjustment allows the algorithm to maintain the highest resolution possible in terms of the histogram bin dimensions when identifying signal photon events. After the algorithm identifies possible signal photon events it then selects additional bins to ensure all signal photon events are included. Generating histograms relative to the ellipsoid can spread the signal photon events into several bins over sloping surfaces, making it less likely that bins containing signal photon events will be correctly identified by the algorithm. However, signal photon events over low-slope regions are readily identified with ellipsoidal-based histograms. Figure 5-2 shows the results from the ellipsoidal histogram step for the segment shown in Figure 5-1. Note that some of the surface apparent in Figure 5-1 was not found in regions with steeper slopes. However, the algorithm does produce a rough approximation of the surface height profile. For fairly flat surfaces, ellipsoidal histogramming should identify all of the signal photon events. Over surface types where significant slopes may be present, two more steps are -- 66 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 51 performed. First, the algorithm performs running linear fits to the surface height profile determined by ellipsoidal histogramming to define the local surface slope, α, and histograms the photon heights relative to α to search for signal returns along a linear trend determined by the adjacent surface slopes.",

In these cases, the algorithm generates slant histograms using a variable surface slope at each time increment, Δtime, within these gaps to try to identify any additional signal photons. For the MABEL granule shown here, there were no large gaps so variable slope slant histogramming was not needed. The algorithm generates a confidence parameter for each likely signal photon event to indicate if the photon was classified with high, medium, or low confidence based on the signal to noise ratio of each histogram bin.

The figures above illustrate the algorithm performance on a segment of MABEL data over land ice. As the algorithm development progressed, it became clear that different surfaces, and different beam energies required different parameter values in order to best identify likely signal photon events and minimize the number of false positives. As described in detail in a companion document, Optimization of Signal Finding Algorithm, we optimized the parameter settings according to surface type (land, ocean, sea ice, land ice, inland water) and beam energy (strong and weak). Consequently, many parameters in Table 5-2 are surface type or beam energy dependent. The likelihood of identifying likely signal photons varies as a function of background rate. We simulated a surface and varied the background photon rate to determine the sensitivity of the photon classification algorithm to background photon rate. In Figure 5-5, the simulated surface is shown on the left with two different background rates. On the right of Figure 5-5, we summarize the results of seven simulations. In general, the surface is classified with high confidence up to a few MHz of background photon events. As the background photon rate increases, the fraction of medium and low-confidence photons increases. Above approximately 10 MHz, there are relatively few high-confidence photons identified, and the surface becomes mainly classified with low-confidence.",

Although the surface used in this example is relatively simple, we expect this example to be a useful example for similarly simple surface topologies, such as the ocean, sea ice, or ice sheet interior. For other more complex surfaces, the background rates where high- or medium- confidence photon events dominate will likely be lower, and low-confidence photon events will likely dominate.

Since the spacecraft can have one of two orientations, the relative positions of strong and weak beams change, depending on this orientation (section 7.5). Using the spacecraft orientation parameter (/orbit_info/sc_orient) we assume the relative position of strong and weak beams are known. The spacecraft orientation is changed in order to maximize solar illumination of the solar panels approximately twice a year. As noted above, each ground track is processed separately and the steps of the algorithm are different depending on the beam energy or strength. If a granule spans a spacecraft rotation, then this algorithm needs to be implemented separately on the portions that occur before and after the rotation. For the rest of this discussion in section 5.1.4 it is assumed that the beam strength remains strong or weak for a given ground track for the whole granule. The algorithm is driven by parameters, many of which are surface type or beam strength dependent. Throughout section 5.1.4 the type of dependency is indicated by (isurf), (ibeamstrength), or both after the parameter the first time it is discussed. Each ground track is processed separately, but processing for the weak beam uses the results from the neighboring strong beam, so the strong beam of each pair must be processed first. The algorithm begins by calculating those variables that are generated once for each ground track (section 5.1.4.1).",

In the event that the surf_type parameter indicates null values for all surface types in a major frame, this indicates that there are no telemetered photons for that major frame, and the algorithm in section 5.1.4 moves on to the next major frame. The background count rate is required in order to calculate a threshold value to determine if photon events in a particular histogram bin are signal or background (section 5.1.4.1.1). While the background rate could be expressed in photons per second, since this algorithm is histogram- based, the algorithm expresses the background rate by the mean, Ha_bg_μ, and standard deviation, Ha_bg_σ, of the number of background photon events of the histogram bins. The values of Ha_bg_μ and Ha_bg_σ are therefore a function of the bin size, δzBG, and along-track integration time, δtBG, of the histogram used for the background calculation Ha_bg. For the strong beams, the atmospheric histogram (spanning ~14 kilometers vertically) is used to calculate Ha_bg. For weak beams the atmospheric histogram is not telemetered so the downlinked photons are used to calcualte Ha_bg. As described above, the downlink band is relatively narrow, (30 meters to ~2000 meters) and depends on the surface type and terrain variation. The atmospheric histograms, Ha, whether telemetered or formed from the downlinked photons, may or may not contain signal photons (clouds, specular surfaces, etc.), but will always contain background counts.",

Fortunately, the telemetry band associated with likely TEP photon events is always narrower (~28m) than those bands that potentially contain signal photon events (never less than 30m). Therefore, if any telemetry band is 29m or less all photons in that band are flagged as likely TEP with a signal_conf_ph value of -2 for the purposes of signal photon identification, and /gtx/heights/quality_ph value of 3. Because the signal finding algorithm is driven by surface-type dependent parameters and searches for a continuous height profile, the surface types traversed by the ground track must be determined (section 5.1.4.2). These surface-type dependent parameters include the number Nseg(isurf) of contiguous segments, the boundaries in time (or major frame count if available) of each contiguous segment (segments denoted by iseg), Timebeg_seg(isurf, iseg) and Timeend_seg(isurf,iseg). The signal finding algorithm (section 5.1.4.2) is then applied to each segment separately. The final step performed at the ground track level is to initialize the signal finding output for that ground track (section 5.1.4.1.3). For each surface type, each segment of a ground track is processed separately through the signal finding steps of the algorithm (section 5.1.4.2). If a given surface type is not present, the algorithm parameters associated with that surface type are not used, and the confidence value is set to -1 (the fill value). The algorithm determines the signal photon events for each time increment of Δtime(isurf) by first forming and evaluating histograms formed with respect to the ellipsoidal surface.",

      "content": "At each Δtime the algorithm creates a histogram of the ellipsoidal photon event heights for a given integration distance, δtPC, using a height bin size of δzPC (section 5.1.4.1.2). Possible signal bins are selected by comparing them to a signal threshold, Thsig, which is calculated from Ha_bg_μ and Ha_bg_σ, after they are appropriately scaled to the specific δtPC and δzPC values used for the ellipsoidal histogram (section 5.1.4.2.2). The selection of the signal bins (section 5.1.4.2.3) is not simply based on this threshold test, but follows a more complicated methodology, which reduces false positives while also selecting any possible signal from surrounding bins that did not pass the threshold test but may contain signal. For each time increment, Δtime, the algorithm varies the integration time, δtPC and height bin size, δzPC (section 5.1.4.2.4), until either signal bins are identified or the upper limits of δtPC and δzPC are reached. This automated adaptation to the specific characteristics of each surface profile is key to selecting all signal photon events while minimizing the number of background photon events erroneously selected as signal. If the background count rate is so small that to use it as a threshold would cause the algorithm to accept all photons as signal, the algorithm first tries to increase δtPC and δzPC (section 5.1.4.2.4) as described above. If this situation still exists at the largest values of δtPC and δzPC then the algorithm takes the bins with the maximum number of photons as the signal bins along with adjacent bins that contain photons (section 5.1.4.2.3). -- 84 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 69 After an initial height profile is formed, a histogram relative to a slope is performed to identify any missed signal photons that were spread out over the slopes (section 5.1.4.2.5).

The lslant parameter determines subsequent steps for the strong beam segments. If lslant(isurf) is set to one (e.g. land or land ice), two signal-finding steps are performed. First, additional signal is sought by histogramming the photon heights relative to the surface defined by a set of running linear fits to the signal photons identified by ellipsoidal histogramming (section 5.1.4.2.5.1). This is referred to as slant histogramming. Second, if gaps in the profile greater than Δtime_gapmin are still present, the algorithm identifies the time intervals over which these gaps occur (section 5.1.4.2.5.3) and then performs slant histogramming over the time interval of each identified gap, systematically varying the slope along which the histogram is formed to find additional signal (section 5.1.4.2.5). This step is referred to as variable slope slant histogramming. If lslant(isurf) is set to zero, we assume the Earth’s surface is essentially flat (e.g. sea ice, ocean) and slant histograming is not performed. For weak beam segments, one additional signal-finding step is performed after ellipsoidal histogramming. Using the final surface profile defined by the neighboring strong beam, the algorithm forms running linear fits to determine local surface slopes and performs slant histogramming relative to these local slopes. Variable slope slant histogramming is not performed for the weak beam, since it is assumed that if a gap still exists that could not be filled by variable slope slant histogramming on the nearby strong beam, then there is no signal in the gap that would be detected by the weak beam. This step requires geographically correlating the strong and weak beams. After identifying likely signal photon events, there is an option (Ledit(isurf)) to perform an nσ edit to a running linear fit over the signal photon events to remove outliers (section 5.1.4.3).",

This helps ensure that photons from secondary surface returns are also flagged (e.g. from vegetation or buildings) even if they have not passed the threshold tests. If a given surface type is present along a given ground track, the algorithm assigns a confidence flag value to each individual telemetered photon event. This flag is initialized to zero and then set to the highest confidence level (2-4) assigned to that photon from either the ellipsoidal or slant histogramming processes or set to one if it was added as padding to assure the minimal height span is achieved. If a given surface type is not present, the confidence parameter remains set to a fill value (-1).

Since Δtime is surface-type dependent, it is suggested that a separate surface type group be output under photon signal output with separate arrays for these three parameters. If a surface type is not traversed by the ground track then that group would then be missing. For each surface type, the above three arrays should be initialized to an invalid value (e.g. -999999.0).

If the telemetry band is very narrow and the algorithm is using a large value of zpc, it is possible that there will not be enough bins for a useful discrimination between signal and noise, as defined by the parameter Nbinmin. If there are are not enough bins at the current value of zpc then increase tpc (if not yet at the maximum value, δtmax) and cycle through all values of zpc . If at δtmax there are still not enough bins for this Δtime increment, the algorithm proceeds to the next time increment.",

If the maximum values for both δtpc and δzPC are reached and the background count rate is close to zero such that the mean is close to machine precision and the standard deviation cannot be calculated, then select all bins where the number of photons is greater than r2 * the number of photons in the bin with the highest photon count, and continue with step 5 of section 5.1.4.2.3 where r2 is as defined in Table 5-2. 5.1.4.2.3 Identify Histogram Bins That May Contain Signal Now that histograms have been generated for a given time interval (section 5.1.4.2.1) and the criteria for distinguishing signal from noise have been determined (section 5.1.4.2.2), the algorithm identifies bins that may contain signal photons. This is performed in four steps. 1) Find the bins, Sigbins, for which the number of photon events are both greater than the threshold, Thsig, (section 5.1.4.2.3.1) and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the bin counts compared to the mean background number of counts > R (the minimum SNR ratio as input in Table 5-2). 2) Divide the bin counts in Sigbins into groups of contiguous height bins (section 5.1.4.2.3.2). The goal here is to collect bins that have passed the prior step into groups; ultimately these groups will be used to evaluate the preceeding and following bins for potential signal. 3) Remove false signal (section 5.1.4.2.3.3) in three steps: a) Remove spurious noise falsely selected as signal by increasing the signal threshold for any groups containing only one bin. This assumes that photons returned from a flat surface (i.e. all signal photons are in one bin) have a very large SNR, and so will pass a more rigourous SNR criteria. Tests on representative MABEL data showed that this removed the vast majority of false positives (e.g. atmospheric returns) while retaining the photon events returned from the surface.",

Tests with MABEL data showed this removed falsely-identified signal that was not connected with the surface (e.g. two or more adjacent atmospheric bins that passed the threshold test above, but have far fewer counts than the bins containing the surface return). This step should remove cases where more than one group of bins passed the threshold and SNR criteria, and down select to the strongest signal. c) Remove any groups that are not a local maxima. The histogram should include regions that contain no photons or only background counts. If a group does not show up as a local maxima within the full histogram, then this indicates that it probably does not contain signal photon events. 4) For ellipsoidal histograms, to ensure selection of all signal photon events, identify additional bins on each side of each remaining signal group that may contain some photon signal events but not enough to have passed the threshold tests (section 5.1.4.2.3.4). This step is not implemented in slant histogramming. 5) Lastly (section 5.1.4.2.3.5), the algorithm identifies signal photons found and assigns a confidence parameter to every photon in those bins that passed the above criteria. 5.1.4.2.3.1 Find Individual Bins That Pass the Threshold and Ratio Test 1. Find possible signal bins. A bin, n, is defined as possibly containing signal if the number of photon events in the bin (Hz(n)) is greater than Thsig (section 5.1.4.2.2) and the ratio of the number of photons to the mean of the background, SNR, is greater than R. Find all values of n where Hz(n) > Thsig and SNR > R where SNR = Hz(n) / μbg_δzpc_δtPC.

Through testing with MABEL and early ATLAS data, we found that groups of bins that were only slightly above the signal threshold were generally false positives. This was most common during low-background conditions, and that by assessing if a group of bins was indeed a local maxima, we are able to reject most of these false positives.

Steps to Vary δtPC and δzPC. If no signal is found for the initial δtPC and δzPC, the algorithm first varies the histogram bin height from δzmin to δzmax1. The algorithm then increases the along-track bin width δtPC and again sweeps through δzPC. If δtmax and δzmax1 are reached, the algorithm scans a larger range of δzPC, limited by δzmax2. This process continues until either the maximum values of δtmax and δzmax2 are reached, or signal is found. This process is shown graphically in Figure 5-5. Figure 5-6 shows how the algorithm varies the histogram bin size, δzpc, in two steps; first from δzmin to δzmax1 and second from δzmax1+δzinc1 to δzmax2. The logic of separating these two steps is that signal is most often found in the region spanned by δtmin to δtmax and δzmin to δzmax1. Therefore, the algorithm checks this region first, before examining larger values of δz. -- 102 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 87 Figure 5-6.

The algorithm then increases δtPC, and again sweeps through the range of δzPC. The process continues until one or more bins are determined to have signal photons. Since δtPC can be greater than Δtime it is possible to find signal photons outside of Δtime although none exist inside Δtime at these larger values of δtPC. If this happens continue increasing δtPC and δzPC until find signal photons within Δtime or the limits are reached and no signal photons are identified. 5.1.4.2.5 Slant Histogramming The term “slant histogramming” is used to describe when the algorithm histograms the photon heights relative to a sloping surface. Two types of slant histogramming are performed. Type one describes where the surface slope is defined along the whole profile by performing running linear fits to the signal photons defined from the ellipsoidal histogram step (section 5.1.4.2.5.1); then the slant histograms are formed relative to the slopes of the linear fits (section 5.1.4.2.5.2) to these likely signal photon heights. Type two describes the situation when type one slant histogramming still leaves large gaps in the profile within a segment.

For each target photon in the unbuffered segment, identify photons that fall within an area defined by /ancillary_data/altimetry/win_x and /ancillary_data/altimetry/win_h, the horizontal and vertical widths, respectively, of the selection window formed about each photon in meters. The default values are set to 15 m and 6 m respectively. Figure 5-8. Selection window formed about a target photon (green) and its closest neighbors (red). Calculate a photon-rate knn value as the maximum of /ancillary_data/altimetry/min_knn (default value of 5) and the square root of the number of selected photons, whichever is larger. If the photon-rate knn value is less than or equal to min_knn, redetermine the photon-rate knn value -- 111 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 96 as the maximum of min_knn and half the number of selected photons, whichever is larger. This helps to improve discrimination in cases of low photon counts where there are less than min_knn squared (default value of 25) photons surrounding the target photon. Calculate the initial weight_ph value as half win_h minus the vertical distance between the target photon and each selected photon, summed for the knn closest neighboring photons. Ignore the target photon itself.",

Calculate the final /gtx/heights/weight_ph value by dividing the initial weight_ph by the product of the geosegment knn and half win_h, making weight_ph unitless. This effectively normalizes the weights to values ranging from 0-1. Multiply the weights by 255 to get unsigned one-byte integers that are stored on ATL03. 5.2.2 Application Photon weights alone do not absolutely discriminate signal from noise since weight values are relative within a 20 m segment. Multiple segments with a relatively uniform signal rate can likely leverage photon weights to find signal using simple thresholding. However, using a weight threshold will not accurately provide the desired signal in segment aggregates with little to no signal, or inconsistent signal to noise. The segment-rate knn values indicate the number of photons surrounding the photon with the highest weight (or density) within each segment. Comparison of the knn values can help determine those segments with consistent maximum photon rates and may indicate suitability of segment aggregation. A frequency distribution of weights may be a useful tool when analyzing ATL03 photon data. The concept is similar to height histogramming, where the goal is to identify one or more signal distributions separately from the noise distribution. The weight value alone only indicates the strength of the signal with respect to the surrounding photons and does not classify the surface. For example, the weight of a photon from a tree canopy could have the same weight as a photon from ground, or it could have a lower or higher weight than photons from the ground. The weight_ph parameter allows users to collect photons (when edited by quality_ph) that are likely signal and can be applied in user algorithms to classify the signal as ground, canopy, subsurface, etc.",

When applicable, the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) conventions from 2010 were adopted. Certain geophysical corrections have not been applied to ATL03 photon heights, as reported on the ATL03 product. These include ocean tides, long- period ocean tides, and dynamic atmospheric corrections; which are offered on the product as reference values for use in higher-level processing (c.f., individual higher-level ATBDs for details) and by ATL03 users who desire to apply corrections selectively (or utilize corrections from alternative sources). Other corrections have been applied, including solid earth tides, solid earth pole tides, ocean pole tides, ocean loading, and atmospheric range delays. 6.1 Introduction From the ATBD for ICESat-2 Receive Photon Geolocation (ATL03g): “The geolocation of an ATLAS photon event is computed as a function of three complex measurements: 1. The position of the space based ranging instrument from the Precision Orbit Determination (POD); 2. The pointing of the laser pulse from the Precision Pointing Determination (PPD), and 3. The photon event round trip travel time observation measured by the ATLAS instrument.” The geolocation of ATLAS photons provides the starting point for the ATL03 science level product.",

      "content": "Each photon event will have been placed within a geodetic coordinate system; the elevations are given in the ITRF2014 reference frame and the geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, and height) are referenced to the WGS-84 ellipsoid based on the G1150 model (ae = 6378137m, 1/f = 298.257223563). In summary, each ATLAS emitted photon passes through the atmosphere and experiences delays that depend on the refractive index along the optical path. The photons ultimately encounter a surface on the Earth (terrestrial, ocean or snow/ice-covered), and are reflected back to the satellite receiver system. The round-trip time of a photon is what constitutes a base input measure for geolocation. Over oceans, sea ice and ice shelf surfaces, each photon event typically requires corrections to account for temporal variability in atmospheric-oceanic interactions (e.g., inverted barometer and wind field effects) as well tidal states and other corrections. Over land surfaces, each photon event requires corrections for ocean loading and solid earth tides. These constitute what are referred to as geophysical corrections. In the most general of terms (omitting, e.g., precision pointing and atmospheric delay corrections), the calculation for sea surface height (SSH) or an analogous land surface height is conceptualized in the following manner. First, an estimate of the photon event height (HP), having the WGS-84 ellipsoid as its reference surface, is formed by the difference: -- 113 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 98 HP = H_satelliteellipsoid - H_satellitesurface where H_satelliteellipsoid represents the satellite height above the WGS-84 ellipsoid (determined by POD) and H_satellitesurface is the height of the satellite above the surface upon which the photon was reflected.",

      "content": "The latter quantity is often referred to as a range, intuitively understood as one half the signal photon round-trip time (consisting of a photon being transmitted at time tT, reflected by the Earth’s surface and then received at time tR) multiplied by the speed of light, c. H_satellitesurface = c(tT - tR)/2 These are fundamental quantities that enter into the precision orbit determination (POD) and photon geolocation processes (ATL03g). Very generally, the photon event height, HP, is corrected for an i-number of temporally and spatially varying geophysical effects (tides, loading, etc., as listed below), represented by Ci which are, by convention, consistently subtracted via Hgc = HP - ∑Ci where Hgc are geophysically-corrected photon event heights referring to the WGS-84 ellipsoid. Some of the corrections in Ci are only applicable over specific surface types. These are described in the following sections. For those interested in obtaining, for example, oceanic photon event heights refer to a mean sea surface (MSS), then the equation becomes SSH = Hgc - MSS = HP - MSS - Ci Clarifying, the photon heights reported on the ATL03 product are referenced to the WGS-84 G1150 ellipsoid (ae = 6378137m, 1/f = 298.257223563) in the ITRF 2014 reference Frame. Ocean tides (short- and long-period), and Dynamic Atmospheric Corrections have not been applied to ATL03 photon heights. ATL03 provides these parameters as reference information, allowing users to, e.g., re-reference heights to the geoid, apply ocean tides, dynamic atmospheric corrections, as needed. By standard convention, and more generally, corrections are subtracted from height values to form corrected heights; if the correction should need to be removed (or “undone,” say, to apply a differently modeled correction), the original correction is added to the corrected height.",

      "content": "With regard to implementation and application of the geophysical corrections, in most cases, a regional calculation (or interpolation) of each geophysical parameter is applied uniformly across a group of photons. Since the density of the photon distribution is very high (with the average along-track distance between sequential laser pulses being ~70 centimeter) and given the locally smooth nature (over ~500 meter distances) for the parameters involved, computation or interpolation of geophysical corrections at every individual photon location is computationally -- 114 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 99 prohibitive. Instead, geophysical corrections are computed or interpolated along each ground track at a sampling distance of 20 meters (corresponding to the along-track segments outlined in section 3.1) and should be applied uniformly over the group of photons within each segment. This is performed independently for each ground track. The reference photons provide a useful regular along-track discretization in space and time. Therefore, the reference photon location and time is used to determine geophysical corrections for all photons in a given along-track segment. While the along-track segments of section 3.1 and the reference photons provide a convenient regular set of points to evaluate these geophysical models, care was taken to ensure that such a sampling interval (~20 meters) was acceptable from a geophysical standpoint. Local and regional geographical variations and sensitivities of the Dynamic Atmospheric Correction (DAC) and ocean tide geophysical correction parameters were investigated to ensure that errors arising from the uniform application of geophysical corrections remain small (sub centimeter level).",

The list below provides typical magnitudes expected for each parameter. A schematic diagram of associated corrections and reference values is shown in Figure 6-1.

The interpolating functions to determine geophysical corrections at a specific point (i.e. the reference photon locations) are described below in the Implementation Plan for each correction.

Ocean tides account for about 70% of the total variability of the ocean surface at daily and half- daily periods (diurnal and semi-diurnal). The effects of tides vary regionally; open ocean areas typically have smaller amplitudes (±0.3m r.m.s) than continental shelves and coastal regions (which can increase to several meters or more). Ocean tide models quantitatively describe the time-variant changes of sea level due to gravitational attraction by the Sun and the Moon. The models are applicable for any point in the oceans, as well as on sea ice and on ice shelves. Modern tide models fall into two broad categories: those which are formed on the basis of purely hydrodynamic numerical modeling; and those that assimilate the hydrodynamics with tidal observations, including satellite altimeters [Le Provost, 2001]. Assimilation models provide accurate measures of tides across all open ocean expanses. An investigation by Stammer et al, (2014) compared and evaluated global ocean tide models. It provides a helpful guide to select from candidate models for use in ocean tidal corrections. Table 6-2 lists ocean tide models currently available.

      "content": "Along some coastlines, tidal heights can vary by more than a centimeter over rather short distances (tens of kilometers). Accurate modeling along coastal zones is particularly challenging. ICESat-2 altimetry will provide an important data resource for improving coastal zone and shallow seas tidal modeling (as well as better modeling tidal effects in polar regions and experienced on ice shelves). Additionally, temporal variations in tidal heights can be significant over short time periods. As an example, a 24-hour tidal time series, with one minute time resolution, from Canada’s Bay of Fundy, well known for its extreme tidal variability, demonstrates that tides can change by as much as 9.75 meters over a six-hour time span. The rate of change approaches ±2.7 centimeters per minute. Therefore, both geolocation position and time are critical inputs for computing and applying oceanic tidal height corrections, especially in coastal regions where high tidal variability can occur. Users should be aware that the GOT4.8 tide model used here provides values at 0.5 degree resolution, so near coastlines and embayments, values should be treated with caution. See the ICESat-2 Data Comparison User Guide for more detail. Figure 6-2.

For locations where the ocean tide is undefined, the value of the ocean tide correction is set to an invalid value (approximately 3.4E38).",

Long period equilibrium tides are computed independently via the Fortran routine, LPEQMT.F. 6.3.2 Inverted Barometer (IB) and Dynamic Atmospheric Correction (DAC) The Dynamic Atmospheric Correction (DAC) is not applied to the photon heights on ATL03 and is provided only as reference values at the geolocation segment rate. The DAC has two main components: (1) a portion that describes the oceanic level response to variations in atmospheric pressure; and (2) a portion that describes mass momentum forcing driven by the highly variable wind stress field. IB Correction describes the first effect, whereas DAC typically describes a combination of both effects. The wind stress field is applicable over open ocean water surfaces. Mass momentum response is further complicated over ice-covered oceans and ice shelves where floating ice dramatically attenuates the influence of the wind field. IB Correction: When atmospheric pressure is low, the ocean level will rise and when atmospheric pressure is high the ocean level is forced down. In this way, the ocean acts as an inverted barometer. The response relationship is approximately stated as: an increase in pressure of 1 mbar (= 1 hPa) will cause the ocean level to drop 1 centimeter. Early models of the correction utilized a mean global pressure, Pref, via the relationship, Dh ≈ -0.99484(Pi - Pref ) where Pi is the local atmospheric pressure in mbar and Pref was, as used by TOPEX, a static value of 1013.3 mbar. Before the advent of global pressure fields (ECMWF or NCEP), the local pressure, Pi, was usually ascertained on the basis of the dry tropospheric correction. Andersen & Scharoo [2011] show that a seasonally variable mean, computed exclusively over the oceans, provides a better value for Pref.",

AVISO’s MOG2D DAC values are provided only for reference; they are not applied to ATL03 photon heights. Each field is approximately 900KB in size. For ICESat-2 processing, the fields will require electronic transfer from AVISO. For each reference photon, its corresponding time, t, is used to select the corresponding 6-hour DAC fields that surround time t (“pre” and “post”). These would each be sampled at the reference photon positions (via bi-linear or bi-cubic geographic interpolation), followed by a linear temporal interpolation. The equation, DACcorrection() = DACpre() + [DACpost() - DACpre()]/6 * (t - tpre) describes the linear temporal interpolation where the DACs have been sampled at lat, lon, () with t given in hours.

      "content": "The procedure for the calculation of the displacements due to solid earth tides recommended by IERS Conventions 2010 [Petit and Luzum, 2010, section 7.1.1], was suggested by Mathews et al. [1997] and consists of two steps. In the first step, the displacement with frequency-independent nominal values of the Love and Shida numbers for the second and third degree of the tidal potential is computed. The vector displacement is expressed in the time domain in terms of the location and the instantaneous position of the Moon and the Sun obtainable from ephemeris (e.g., JPL Development Ephemeris DE421). In the second step, corrections to the results of the first step are computed in the frequency domain. They take account of the frequency-dependent deviations of the Love and Shida numbers and also of the variations arising from mantle anelasticity. The number of spectral components for which such computations have to be done may be minimized by appropriate choice of nominal values used in the first step (see Mathews et al., 1997). This procedure is utilized in the DEHANTTIDEINEL.F program as well as in Dennis Milbert’s SOLID.F program system. More recent developments include the consideration of lateral inhomogeneities in the elastic Earth model [Latychev et al., 2009], but inclusion of such effects cause deformations on the ±1 mm level [Fok, 2012], and are negligible for ICESat-2 altimetry. Consistency between the ICESat-2 orbit determination is desirable. The solid earth tides, applied to the photon event heights on ATL03, are computed in a tide-free system that realizes a conventional tide free crust (i.e. ITRF), omitting the deformation of the permanent tide. Users must take special note when handling transformations of photon event heights. Users are encouraged to consult Chapter 2 of the Data Comparison User’s Guide for details about such transformations. When required, a latitude-dependent term, tide_earth_free2mean, is available on the ATL03 product.",

In order to be consistent with the ICESat-2 Precision Orbit Determination process, ATL03 uses a process recommended by the IERS 2010 conventions.

This value is subtracted from the group photon heights above the ellipsoid. This is performed globally for all measured heights. 6.3.4 Ocean Loading This correction removes the deformation of the Earth’s crust due to the weight of overlying ocean tides. As the tides rise and fall, mass is added or lost in the water column and this mass redistribution cause loading of the ocean bottom. Conceptually, ocean loading is computed by integrating the ocean tides and applying a weighting function, G, a(r) = A  Z(r’) G|r - r’| dA where a is the loading displacement at the station located at r. The ocean tide at r’ is given in its complex form, 𝑍 = 𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒 ∗ exp (𝑖 phase). r is the mean density of sea water and G is the Green’s function for the distance |r – r’|. The integral is taken over all global water masses, A. Although too simplistic for ICESat-2 requirements, a more practical formulation uses a grid [Petit and Luzum, 2010].",

Geocenter motion largely reflects global scale mass redistributions in the atmosphere and oceans, as well as continental water variations. Geocenter motions possess definite seasonal components in all three directions: X (amplitude 2.7 mm), Y (amplitude 2.8 mm), and Z (amplitude 5.2 mm) [Cheng et al., 2013]. Secular terms along each axis have been estimated to be: -0.2 mm/yr (X), 0.3 mm/yr (Y), and -0.5 mm/yr (Z), with formal uncertainties at about those same levels. The ICESat-2 precision orbit determination (POD) is computed in the CM frame and is directly used in the geolocation of the laser surface returns. Therefore, the geolocated surface returns are in the CM frame.. Cheng et al., (2013) point out that the CF's dynamic tie to the CM is not yet a component of the conventional model of ITRF. Since the dynamic tie of the CF to the CM has not received formal, international agreement, nor has it been introduced into the ITRF by the IERS, this effect is not at a stage for empirical application as a geophysical correction, and therefore is not included as a correction of the ICESat-2 surface returns from CM to the CF frame.",

Two of these groups are the ATLAS impulse response function and related parameters (section 7.2) and the background count parameter (section 7.3). Several of the higher-level data products (e.g.",

While, in general, the time-dependent ATLAS instrument-response function is not known on orbit on a per-shot basis, section 7.2 presents an algorithm for estimating this function. In addition, several higher-level data products require an estimate of the solar background rate of photon events. The amount of photon data downlinked is not sufficient to generate a robust estimate of the background count rate. Instead, ATL03 provides histograms generated and used onboard by the flight software. Section 7.4 introduces parameters used to determine each received photon event uniquely, and allows traceability to specific detectors or timing channels within ATLAS. 7.2 ATLAS Impulse-Response Function 7.2.1 ATLAS Start Pulse Detector The temporal distribution of signal photon events detected by ATLAS combines the temporal profile of the transmitted laser pulse shape with the effects of the ATLAS transmit optics, passage though the atmosphere, reflection off the surface of the Earth, passage through the atmosphere again, and finally passage through the ATLAS receive optics and electronics. In order to remove the effects induced by ATLAS on the temporal distribution of signal photon events, several higher-level data product algorithms use deconvolution to distinguish instrument and geophysical effects to determine the ellipsoidal height of the Earth’s surface. The small- signal instrument temporal effects are collectively described as the ATLAS impulse-response function.",

The ATLAS impulse-response function was characterized prior to launch during ground testing, and included measurements of the effects of the optics on the temporal distribution of the transmit and received laser pulse, and the temperature- and voltage-dependent impact of the photon-detection electronics. While it is not possible to characterize the ATLAS impulse- response function on-orbit for every transmitted laser pulse, this section presents an estimate of this function derived from on-orbit data. These data are grouped into two categories (and associated subgroups): pulse energy and impulse-response. The transmitted pulse energy will primarily vary due to the variable laser transmitter output, at least over short (less than six month) timescales. We do not expect significant impact from changes in the transmit optical path, though efficiency changes are possible over the life of the mission (e.g. due to cumulative contamination). The ATLAS instrument has several methods of monitoring the output laser energy which are described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 of ATL02.

      "content": "Transmitted Pulse Energy Parameters. The temporal distribution of transmitted photons (sometimes referred to as the “pulse shape”) for each beam for each shot is not known on orbit (though these data are available from pre-launch calibration products). However, there are two sources of information to estimate the on-orbit ATLAS impulse-response function: threshold crossing times from the start pulse detector (SPD) and photon events recorded from the transmitter echo pulse (TEP). The ATLAS SPD provides the time that the transmit pulse crosses two energy thresholds on both the leading edge of the pulse and on the trailing edge of the pulse; thereby providing four crossing times. In order to mitigate the effects of pulse-to-pulse variation in phase between the mode-beating peaks and the pulse envelope, these measurements are made after a low-pass filter in the SPD. These crossing times are used (along with other data) in ATL02 to generate a best- possible laser pulse transmit time. Photon event receive times are correlated with, and differenced from, the laser pulse transmit time to calculate the photon time of flight that is a primary input to ATL03. The laser transmit time is the best estimate of the first moment (mean) of the transmit laser pulse. The four crossing times are combined in ATL02 to make an estimate of the width of the transmit laser pulse. The differences between the lower threshold crossing times and upper threshold crossing times are provided in the tx_pulse_width_lower and tx_pulse_width_upper parameters, and have units of seconds. The associated thresholds (tx_pulse_thresh_lower and tx_pulse_thresh_upper) are also provided, in units of volts. In order to synchronize these data with the transmit pulse energy parameters, the differences described above are calculated on a per-shot basis, and then the differences are averaged over ~20 meters (~28 shots) to provide a single value for each ICESat-2 geolocation segment on ATL03.",

The four crossing times are also combined in ATL02 to estimate the third moment (skew) of the transmit laser pulse, also at the ~20 meter rate.

Transmit Pulse Parameters. 7.2.2 ATLAS Transmitter Echo Path An estimate of the ATLAS impulse-response function is derived from the transmitter echo path (TEP) photon events. The TEP is an optical path that provides a means to calibrate ATLAS time of flight internally, and is described in detail in ATL02. Briefly, light following the optical path of the TEP begins at the laser, travels to the laser sampling assembly where part of the transmitted laser pulse is sampled, and then via a fiber optic cable to the optical filter assembly to the detector array assembly. In this way, photons detected via the TEP traverse part of the transmit optical path, part of the receive optical path, and all of the receiver electronics that all other signal photons traverse. The TEP exists for two of the three strong beams (ATLAS spots 1 and 3, also called beam 1 and 3 in this section; as noted elsewhere, depending on the spacecraft orientation these will be the strong beam of the central pair of beams, and the strong beam of either the right or left pair).",

Here, we first establish criteria for a set of TEP data, and then distinguish possible TEP photon events from the possible signal photon events determined in ATL02 section 4.0, and then develop an estimate of the ATLAS impulse response function for each of the two beams with TEP photon events. The TEP photon events will be downlinked either when commanded to or when the TEP photon events happen to occur within the telemetry band. Pre-launch analysis indicates that the TEP will -- 135 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 120 fall within the telemetry band approximately twice per orbit, for about three hundred seconds in each instance. Additional instances of TEP photon events can be captured and telemetered by manipulating parameters in the flight software. Pre-launch data analysis shows that the number of TEP photons per shot for a particular beam varies; owing to changes in laser transmit energy, and the temperature-sensitive reflectivities of the fiber optics involved. However, the ratio of the number of TEP photons between beams 1 and 3 appears stable with a value of 0.7, with beam 1 being the stronger of the two. Averaging across a range of instrument configurations, beam 1 generates approximately 0.09 TEP photons per shot, and beam 3 generates approximately 0.07 TEP photons per shot. Using one TEP photon event per twenty shots as the lower limit for the TEP strength, downlinking TEP photons for approximately three hundred seconds (i.e. the approximate duration TEP photons will fortuitously appear in the telemetry band) should yield about 150,000 TEP photons.",

As a secondary check, there must be at least 2000 possible TEP photons in the set. All available TEP photons within a given set are used; there is no upper limit on the duration or number of TEP photons. The set is ended when the TEP photons are no longer present in the telemetry band, or five seconds have passed with no additional TEP photons. With a sufficient number of possible TEP photon events identified, possible TEP photon events should be either background photon events, misclassified signal photon events, or TEP photon events. The time of day of the start of the TEP data used in subsequent analyses is reported on ATL03 as tep_tod, while the duration of TEP data is reported as tep_duration. Using this reduced set of possible TEP photon events, we form a histogram using 50 picoseconds bin widths. Although the nominal mean finest time resolution of the ATLAS system is ~190 picoseconds, since the laser start time is the average of the four threshold crossings, we use a finer time resolution in this histogram.

The TEP window width is about one hundred nanoseconds (defined in ATL02 as a possibly non-symmetric region about the TEP photon events; see section 4.2 in ATL02), which result in approximately two thousand bins in the TEP histogram. We expect the transmit pulse leaving the laser to have a width of ~1.5 ns full-width at half max, or approximately thirty bins of this histogram. In order to remove the full primary and secondary pulses from the background calculation, as well as ramp up and ramp down features in the last ~10 ns of each TEP realization, the mean background is determined by calculating the mean number of counts of the collective bins between 25 and 40 ns and 55 and 90 ns, inclusively. This value is reported on the output product as tep_bckgrd. Subtract tep_bckgrd from all bin counts. After removing the background, calculate the number of counts in the remaining histogram. Report this value as tep_hist_sum. Divide the number of counts in each bin by tep_hist_sum in order to normalize the histogram to have unit area. Report the normalized values for each bin as tep_hist and the time of the bin centers (the mean of the times of the leading and trailing edges of the bins) as tep_hist_time. This normalized histogram is the best on-orbit estimate of the ATLAS impulse-response function. Note that this histogram includes both the primary and secondary arrivals. It is recommended to focus on the shape of the primary TEP arrivals in subsequent downstream processing when the ATLAS impulse-response function is required. We also calculate the standard deviation of the normalized counts in the region used to determine the background rate (i.e. the standard deviation of tep_hist bin counts between 25 to 40 ns and 55 to 90 ns) to provide a measure of the background uniformity.",

Based on pre-launch data collected during integration and testing, we expect the pulse spreading in the portion of the optical path not sampled to be small compared with the pulse spreading in the part of the system sampled by the TEP. In post-launch data analysis, users have detected two additional echoes that are approximately three orders of magnitude smaller than the primary ATLAS transmit pulse. These additional echoes are generally not apparent in individual TEP realizations, but can be revealed by carefully aggregating many TEP realizations together. The parameters derived from TEP data are part of the ATL03 data product in the groups /atlas_impulse_response/pce1_spot1/ and /atlas_impulse_response/pce2_spot3/ and are listed in the table below. For flexibility, the TEP parameters are calculated and stored in an ancillary data product (ANC41) prior to writing them to the ATL03 data granules. Given the latency involved in generating ATL03, a full day’s worth of realizations of the TEP are drawn from ATL02 and are collected into the daily ANC41 data product. ANC41 is generated any time ATL02 is generated, even if ATLAS is not in nominal science mode.

Each ATL03 granule contains the realization of the TEP-based parameters drawn from ANC41 that is nearest in time, and that passes the following three criteria.

Third, to reject cases where the TEP peaks are noticeably shifted in time or amplitude, the maximum absolute difference between the normalized histograms of the reference TEP (described below) and each TEP realization must be less than 0.004. TEP realizations that fail these tests are not included on ATL03. Analyses of average day-time versus night-time TEP realizations (meeting versus failing above tests, respectively) show negligible differences in primary and secondary pulse peaks and centroids, suggesting TEP characteristics on ATL03 are accurately represented using only the night-time TEP. We expect to continue to refine our TEP selection criteria and TEP processing to include more day-time TEP realizations in the future. The parameter tep_tod indicates when the TEP data on a given ATL03 granule was generated.

The first is tep_valid_spot, a 6x1 array indicating which TEP to use for each spot that does not have a TEP associated with it (e.g. which TEP to use to characterize spots 2, 4, 5, and 6). The second is tep_range_prim, a 2x1 array indicating the range of time of flight of TEP photon events to include in generating a histogram or other analysis of the primary TEP return.

      "content": "We also have described the TEP photon events and have formed a histogram and related parameters based on TEP events. Since the times of these respective groups are known, it is possible to examine how the SPD-based statistics vary during the period spanned by the TEP data. However, combining these two groups quantitatively is complicated by two aspects. First, the SPD-based data and the TEP-based data have unique paths through the instrument and so the reported times of these data will be substantially different. While these differences are characterized with pre-launch data, we have little insight into how the temporal bias between these data will evolve through time. Secondly, the SPD-based data is derived from the reported times when a filtered version of the transmitted laser pulse crosses a particular amplitude threshold (measured in volts). The TEP- based data on the other hand is a histogram of counts of a massively attenuated version of the transmitted laser pulse. As such a quantitative correspondence between voltages and counts is problematic. A relationship could possibly be made between the standard deviation of the threshold crossing times and the apparent width of the TEP-based histogram at several points along the profile. This may allow a user to better predict how the transmitted pulse is changing between realizations of the TEP. Recall that any photon events in a band that is 29 m wide or less should be classified as TEP. In very rare cases, cloudy conditions cause the surface to be in this TEP band for a short period. Future improvements to TEP flagging will aim to recover the surface in these cases. To prevent confusion between signal photons and TEP returns, a possible TEP flag is included as part of the signal_conf_ph parameter as a value of -2. The possible TEP flagging procedure described below ensures surface signal and background photons are not unintentionally flagged as possible TEP.",

This process is described in detail in the ATLAS Science Receiver Algorithms Description document. Ideally, the altimetric histogram includes the Earth’s surface and extends some distance above and below it. This histogram is formed using photon event counts over a period of time (rather than range or height). The duration of the altimetric histogram varies with location around the Earth and is determined by the surface type and the precision with which the ellipsoidal height of the Earth’s surface is known. Since each beam is processed separately by the onboard processing software, the altimetric histogram details can be different for each of the six beams.",

The 50-shot sum is used to derive an estimate of the background count rate. First, subtract the number of likely signal photons (from section 5.1.4.2) found in this 50-shot interval. For a given 50-shot interval, the number of signal photons (n_signal_photons) is determined by summing the number of photons with signal_conf_ph == 2, 3 or 4, using the maximum value for any surface type in the interval. It is possible that additional photons are included in the altimetric histogram due to ATLAS instrument effects in saturated conditions. If the photon-rate parameter /gtx/heights/quality_ph indicates photons are likely present due to ATLAS instrument effects, the altimetric histograms and the derived background count rates may be misleading. See Section 7.7.3 for further discussion of saturation effects. Given that photons from the Transmitter Echo pulse (described in Section 7.2.2) may appear in the altimetric histogram and generate an erroneously large background rate, ATL03 determines if TEP photons are in the altimetric histogram. TEP photons follow the laser transmit time by < 70 nanoseconds (see ATL02, Section 4), and are separated in time by the laser repetition rate (100 microseconds).

There are several methods possible to determine if a laser transmit (and it’s associated TEP photons) occur within the altimetric histogram duration. One way is to compare the modulo of the altimetric histogram start time with the laser fire interval (100 microseconds) with the altimetric histogram duration. If the modulo is less than the altimetric histogram duration, the TEP is likely in the altimetric histogram. ATL02 uses a more sophisticated approach, described in the ATL02 ATBD, section 4.3. Pre-launch analysis demonstrates that the TEP strength varies through time and as a function of which laser (primary or redundant) is active. Therefore, the correction to the 50-shot sum is time-dependent. Using ANC41, we determine the mean number of photons per shot in the primary TEP signal (between 15 and 24 nanoseconds; see section 7.2) and the secondary TEP signal (between 43 and 50 nanoseconds; see section 7.2) using an entire day of TEP realizations. We then scale these mean values to determine the average number of TEP photons in 50 shots for the strong beams with the TEP. The resulting values (around 8 photons for beam 1 and around 5 photons for beam 3) are subtracted from the 50-shot sum of the altimetric histogram. If subtraction would yield a negative number for the 50-shot sum, the 50-shot sum is set to zero photons. These values are updated daily when a new ANC41 is available and are used in processing a full day of ATL03. We expect the TEP strength to change slowly through time and we will update this algorithm on-orbit if needs be. For computational efficiency, these values are generated as part of the ANC41 processing and are available in the tep_histogram group of ANC41.",

Lastly, ATL03 converts the duration of the altimetric histogram reported by ATLAS to a distance, or height, in meters: bckgrd_int_height = /atlas/pcex/altimetry/s_w/alt_rw_width * c/2 where the alt_rw_width is the altimetric range window width from ATL02 in units of seconds. The integration height of the 50-shot sum must also be reduced by the height spanned by the signal photons. Determine the height span of the signal photons by calculating the difference in the maximum and minimum ellipsoidal heights of the signal photons with signal_conf_ph == 2, 3 or 4. This should produce a height in meters that spans the ellipsoidal heights of all signal photons in this interval. The reduced integration height is then: bckgrd_int_height_reduced = bckgrd_int_height – signal photon height range. The background photon rate is then given by bckgrd_rate = bckgrd_counts_reduced / (50 * bckgrd_int_height_reduced / (c/2) ) where c is the speed of light. We acknowledge that every fourth value could be in error by up to one part in fifty due to the potential irregular number of shots in the reported 50-shot sums. Post-launch, at least one preliminary ATL03 granule contained unexpectedly large bckgrd_rate values coincident with a negative solar angle (i.e. at night). In this case, values of bckgrd_int_height_reduced were roughly halved, but the values of bckgrd_counts_reduced remained virtually unchanged, effectively increasing the calculated bckgrd_rate.

For the weak beams (and for the strong beams when the atmospheric histograms are not available), the background count rate needed in section 5.1.4.1.1 is nominally derived from the telemetered photon data (i.e. the photon cloud). In order to make pseudo-atmospheric histograms from the photon cloud, two pieces of information are needed: • the ellipsoidal height of the top of the telemetry band, and • the width of the telemetry band in meters. The ellipsoidal height of the top of the telemetry bands with respect to WGS-84 is determined during the geolocation process, as described in section 3.3. Effectively, this treats the telemetry band top as though it were a photon event, and calculating the range and position for that imaginary photon event along with all of the other telemetered photon events. In order to make the height of the top of the telemetry bands consistent with the photon event heights, the geophysical corrections of section 6.0 are also applied to the ellipsoidal height of the top of the telemetry window. The telemetry band width in meters is determined by multiplying the telemetry band width (ATL02, /atlas/pcex/altimetry/s_w/bandx_width) in seconds by the speed of light. These two parameters are therefore tlm_top_bandx (meters above the WGS-84 ellipsoid including the corrections of section 6.0), tlm_height_bandx (in meters). The suffix x refers to the band number (1, 2, … corresponding to the ATL02 parameter N_bands), with 1 corresponding to the first downlink band and the subsequent values corresponding to sequential downlink bands.",

ATL03 includes the sc_orient parameter in the group /orbit_info/ to record the observatory information. The orientation is tracked on-orbit by the Instrument Support Facility (ISF) and is passed to ATL03 via the ANC13 ancillary file. As noted above, the mapping between the strong and weak beams of ATLAS and their relative position on the ground depend on the observatory orientation (Figure 10-1 and Figure 10-2). The forward orientation (sc_orient == 1) corresponds to ATLAS traveling along the +x coordinate in the ATLAS instrument reference frame (see ATL02).

These tables are included in the group /ancillary_data/calibration in individual subgroups for each of the individual calibration products. These products were produced by the ATLAS pre-launch calibration team, and passed to ATL03 via ATL02. Each of these calibration products included on ATL03 are described below. 7.6.1 first_photon_bias: CAL-19, First Photon Bias The first photon bias correction consists of a table of time of flight correction values (in seconds) versus the apparent return pulse strength (measured in returned photon events per laser transmit pulse) and width for several dead-time values. If applied to photon times of flight, this correction is added to the raw time of flight to get corrected time of flight values. Each model- generated table applies to a specific dead time of the ATLAS detectors. The correction is a function of the apparent return width, the dead time, and the apparent return strength (events per shot). This calibration be applied when computing a surface height for an aggregation of photon heights (for instance, an upper-level data product such as ATL06 or ATL07). If applied to a higher-level product, the resulting bias in picoseconds is first converted to distance and then subtracted from the uncorrected heights. The uncorrected centroid is biased early in the transmit pulse, since ATLAS is more likely to detect photons on the leading edge of the return. This correction accounts for that bias.",

Note that these first photon bias corrections are non-linear and are not appropriate under fully saturated conditions. In those cases, other strategies are needed to estimate the number of photon events (and their arrival times) that may have been missed by ATLAS. Since the first photon bias correction depends on how many shots are combined to determine the correction, ATL03 provides the means to estimate the bias to suit each users’ needs. Note that the higher-level data products include a first-photon bias correction already, so an end user should only do their own correction if deriving elevations from the ATL03 photon heights. Under the /ancillary_data/calibrations/first_photon_bias/gtx/ group is the ffb_corr table, with dimensions X-by-Y-by-Z where the X is the detector dead_time (in seconds), Y is the return pulse strength (in photons per shot), and Z is the return pulse width (in nanoseconds). The following steps describe how to find the appropriate array indices in the ffb_corr tables provided. First, determine the dead time for the desired ground track under the /ancillary_data/calibrations/dead_time/gtx group, which contains a dead_time parameter in seconds with dimensions 1x20. The first 16 values correspond to the 16 channel-specific dead time corrections for the strong beam, and the last 4 values correspond to the 4 channel-specific corrections for the weak beam. This allows for a channel-specific dead time correction, if desired. To determine the average dead time correction for a strong (weak) beam, take the mean of the first 16 values (last 4 values).",

First, determine the along-track aggregation distance (and number of ATLAS laser pulses) suitable for your application.

CAL-20 provides histograms of normalized system impulse responses separated by channel and is provided as centroid-aligned histograms. As this was developed pre-launch, it is available for a number of ATLAS system states (temperature, receiver channel, laser energy mode, detector bank (primary or redundant), return source (TEP or MAAT), and laser (primary or redundant)). As a result of using a variety of ATLAS system states, the selections span the expected range of variation of the system impulse response. Each impulse response represents roughly ten million shots, or 15 minutes of data. Small differences in histogram amplitude and shape can help determine which TEP impulse responses (spots 1 and 3) to use on-orbit for the other spots (spots 2, 4, 5, 6).

These PMTs detect photons and convert them into electrical signals that are then timed, stored and telemetered to determine elevation in ground processing. Upon detection of a photon, there is a non-zero time period (the dead time) within which the PMT is effectively blind to additional incoming photons. The ATLAS detector design is that of a non-paralyzable detector, such that after the dead time has passed, ATLAS can detect and record additional photon arrivals. The Cal-42 instrument calibration provides a consistent estimation of dead time for each ATLAS receiver channel accompanied by a standard deviation. This is reported as a table of estimated dead times (one per channel). Although the photon ID allows us to discriminate between photons detected on a rising clock edge from those on a falling clock edge, the differences in electronics that cause a timing difference between the edge are downstream of the PMTs and associate deadtimes.",

The precision on the resulting dead time is 30 picoseconds. These dead times are based on pre-launch ATLAS test data. In short, the calibration is based on photon inter-arrival times for each channel (see section 7.4 for discussion of channels). The interarrival times are histogrammed, with the bin widths and bounds of these histograms are specified as algorithm parameters. While qualitatively, the dead time could be thought of as sharp edge in photon interarrival time (with no photons exhibiting interarrival times less than the dead time), in fact there is a range of deadtimes, and the number of interarrival events decays to zero as a function of apparent dead time. The mean of the bin counts of the histogram from the end of the dead time window (nominally between 2 and 3.5 nanoseconds) to the upper limit of the histogram is computed, and this value is taken as the peak value of the deadtime. By using this peak value, the range of the dead time effect is computed by including bin counts between 10% and 90% of the peak; these values are limited to be within the bounds of the dead time window. The center of the dead time effect is computed using the range determined in the previous step. The output on ATL03 for cal_42 are the mean dead times, as defined above, and the standard deviations for each channel, for detector side that was active at the start of a given granule. Changes in detector side generate a break in ATL03 data, so we do not expect the detector side to change during a granule. 7.7 Other ATLAS and Spacecraft Parameters There are a number of other ATLAS and spacecraft parameters that are not associated with the sections above.

This parameter tracks the number of consecutive orbits over the life of the mission and is incremented at the equatorial crossing of the ascending node of the orbit. The corresponding RGT number of the first orbit will depend on the particulars of the launch and injection into our orbit. After orbit number one is determined, this parameter will have the same cadence as the orbit_info/rgt parameter. This section will be updated shortly after launch, when orbit number 1 is identified. 7.7.2 Uncorrelated Height Uncertainty The sigma_h parameter in the /gtx/geolocation group is the total height uncertainty of a given reference photon, including the effects of electronics timing jitter, the transmit pulse width, radial orbit uncertainty, pointing angle uncertainty, among other terms (see Section 3.3.2). Given the short distance between consecutive reference photons, (~20 m) sigma_h should be used for the height uncertainty of any photon in that along-track geolocation segment. At times, it may be beneficial to have an estimate of the uncorrelated height uncertainty that averages out over length scales of tens of meters (or a few geolocation segments). These are the uncertainty components that are random at the laser transmit rate, such as electronics timing jitter or the effects of the transmit pulse width.

Pre-launch analysis combined the individual timing uncertainties of the transmitter components, the receiver components, and the laser pulse width to generate a single photon time of flight uncertainty (~800 ps).

For the strong two beams with the TEP (beams 1 and 3), the 1-sigma pulse width is based on the standard deviation of the width of a single TEP histogram. To determine this, calculate the weighted standard deviation of the normalized bin counts (i.e. tep_hist values) for bins between 15 and 24 nanoseconds (the region of the primary return), where the primary return bin values are weighted by the corresponding normalized bin counts, and the mean is the weighted mean.

For the four other beams, the TEP_valid_spot parameter is used to determine which TEP width to use for the non-TEP beams.

Over highly reflective surfaces, the returned laser pulse is strong enough that the majority of the ATLAS timing channels are active. In these cases, higher level data products can incur a first-photon bias (section 7.6.1) as well as a bias in the radiometry (section 7.6.3). When ATLAS is fully saturated, it is most likely that existing first photon bias (deadtime) corrections are not accurate, as it is impossible to determine how many photons have been lost. It has been observed that when the ATLAS detectors are fully saturated, then the surface return photons will show a gap in height with no reported photons for the duration of the detector deadtime (approximately 3.2 nanoseconds). In these saturated or nearly-saturated conditions, on-orbit ATL03 data also shows two apparent additional surfaces approximately ~2.3 m and ~4.2 m below the primary surface return. Analyses of pre-launch data suggest these characteristics are effects of the ATLAS instrument in saturation conditions, and not likely true surface. The additional returns typically have 1/1000 the energy of the primary return, but can appear visually prominent in along-track photon plots. A subset of these cases also shows a broad cloud of photons centered around ~30 m below the primary surface return. Investigations of pre-launch data indicate that these returns originate in the ATLAS instrument and therefore exist in all ATLAS data and are part of the ATLAS impulse- response function (section 7.2), but are not usually visible in along-track photon cloud plots. These afterpulses appear strongest when ATLAS receives high photon return rates beyond the design specifications, such as in near-saturation conditions, or when data is aggregated over long distances or times.",

The calibration periods include regular ocean scans and round-the-world scans used to calibrate pointing, ranging, and timing parameters where the spacecraft off-points from the reference ground track for at least 8 minutes. Calibration flags are set with a 60-second buffer before and after a scan period to account for spacecraft off-pointing slews. For more detail on calibration scans, see Section 5.2 of the ICESat-2 POD ATBD. A POD/PPD flag value of zero is nominal, and considered the best available data. A non-zero flag may suggest periods potentially impacting data quality, including degraded geolocation and/or a calibration period. Flag values of 1-3 denote potentially degraded Precise Orbit Determination (POD) or Precision Pointing Determination (PPD) solutions. A value of 4 indicates nominal data during an ATLAS calibration period. Flag values of 5-7 denote potentially degraded geolocation solutions during an ATLAS calibration scan period. See Table 10.1 for details.",

Three primary statistics will be generated for each ground track and for each surface type and included in the /quality_asssessment/ group on the product. These parameters are grouped by ground track into the /gtx/ subgroups. The total number of low-, medium- and high-confidence signal photons for each surface type present in a particular ATL03 granule are provided in qa_total_signal_conf_ph_low, qa_total_signal_conf_ph_med, and qa_total_signal_conf_high, respectively. Each of these are 1 x 5 arrays, corresponding to the 5 surface types ordered as land, ocean, sea ice, land ice, inland water. These values correspond to the total number of low-, medium-, or high-confidence signal photons for a given surface type, where the surface type is determined at the along-track geolocation segment rate (~20m along track). Any particular along-track geolocation segment can be classified as more than one surface type, owing to the overlap between surface masks, as described in Section 4. The percentage of low-, medium- and high-confidence signal photons for each surface type present in a particular ATL03 granule are provided in qa_perc_signal_conf_ph_low, qa_perc_signal_conf_ph_med, and qa_perc_signal_conf_high respectively. Each of these are 1 x 5 arrays, corresponding to the 5 surface types ordered as land, ocean, sea ice, land ice, inland water. They are the ratio of the number of signal photons of a particular confidence to the total number of photons from all geolocation segments similarly classified.",

Recall that the reference photon is also reported at the geolocation segment rate. Beginning with Release 003, the percent of granule geolocation segments with the absolute difference between reference photon height and DEM height exceeding a threshold are reported as a qa metric to quickly assess ATL03 granule quality. These metrics are calculated separately for high, medium, low, and other (buffer and noise) confidence reference photons. Because reference photons are selected without considering surface type, only one value is reported for each confidence level. The parameters and their associated thresholds are: qa_height_diff_DEM_ref_ph_high (> 50 m) qa_height_diff_DEM_ref_ph_med (> 100 m) qa_height_diff_DEM_ref_ph_low (> 200 m) qa_height_diff_DEM_ref_ph_other (> 200 m) -- 156 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 141 Lastly, the parameter qa_perc_surf_type is the percent of the granule that is classified as land, ocean, sea ice, land ice, or inland water, and is also a 1 x 5 array for each ground track.

This was done to facilitate the ingest and easy transfer of browse imagery between SIPS, NSIDC, and end users. (1) Maps of medium- and high-confidence reference photon locations for each of the three strong beams. The existence of medium- and high-confidence reference photons is a good predictor of additional medium- or high-confidence signal photons. These three maps are an indication of where the signal-to-noise ratio in a given granule is good. Since these photon classifications are surface-type dependent, these three maps use the highest confidence for a given photon as the basis for the photon confidence plotted here. For example, if a photon is classified as high- confidence signal for surface type A and as medium confidence for surface type B, the higher confidence is used in these plots.

These images give a user a depiction of what the low-, medium-, and high- confidence photon cloud looks like for each of the three strong beams. The low-confidence photons are plotted first, then the medium confidence, then the high-confidence. Consequently, the low confidence photons are generally only prominently visible if there are few high or medium confidence photons in a particular segment.

The development team has incorporated code written for the GLAS_HDF effort into the ATLAS codebase to 1) ensure CF-compliance, 2) to make the ATLAS products NetCDF-compatible, and 3) provide necessary metadata in accordance with current standards (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about-eosdis/requirements). The ATL03 product design continues to evolve and we welcome comments on the design of the HDF5 files. In ATL03, attributes (rather than datasets) are used for non-science data parameters because of HDFGroup recommendations. Attributes are significantly more efficient for containing small amounts of data. The primary information affected by this change is metadata and ancillary data. The development team realizes this may require changing existing software by the user community, but such ancillary data should improve processing efficiency. ATLAS metadata was designed to match the existing ICESat GLAS_HDF metadata implementation. CF-style global metadata has been enhanced to contain much more information. The structured metadata in the initial release of ATL03 has adopted GLAS_HDF’s pseudo- ECHO style of grouped collection and inventory-level metadata.",

Depending on the upper-level product being considered, there are three potential methods for making such a connection. (1) Using Geolocation Segment IDs. Many higher level products include the segment_ID parameter from ATL03. This parameter is in the group /gtx/geolocation/ on ATL03 and is a seven-digit number uniquely identifying each along-track segment. These are sequential, starting with one for the first segment after an ascending equatorial crossing node, and are defined in Section 3.1.2, step 5.",

      "content": "To find the photons in a given segment, use the parameter /gtx/geolocation/ph_index_beg corresponding to that segment, which provides the index of the first photon in a given segment. This index, and the index of the subsequent along-track segment, can be used to bracket the indices of photon data in the /gtx/heights/ group. For example, if the ph_index_beg is i and the following ph_index_beg is j for two particular along-track segments, the corresponding photon heights are /gtx/heights/h_ph(i:j). Caveat: the ph_beg_index parameter (and the reference_photon_index parameter) are unique to a specific granule, since the index counts sequentially from the first photon in the granule. If a granule is subsetted, care must be taken to either preserve the utility of the indexes, or they should be handled with caution. (2) Using time. Many higher-level products include the cumulative time since the last equatorial crossing of an ascending node of an orbit (i.e. the cumulative time since the beginning of a particular RGT). Each major group in ATL03 includes the delta_time parameter, at the appropriate rate, that can be used to connect higher level parameters to ATL03 parameters. For example, to find all the photons in a given along-track geolocation segment, extract the beginning and end times of the segment in question from the /gtx/geolocation/delta_time parameter, and find the indexes of all photon between those start and stop times in the /gtx/heights/delta_time parameter. (3) Using along-track distance. Several higher-level products include parameters that define the cumulative along track distance since the last ascending node equatorial crossing. The group /gtx/geolocation/ includes the segment_dist_x parameter which defines the starting along-track distance for each along-track geolocation segment.",

GPS seconds do not include leap seconds; another conversion to UTC seconds is necessary. Between 14 Oct 2018, and at least 1 Nov 2020, subtract 18 seconds from the GPS time to yield UTC time. To determine the number of seconds spanned in a particular ATL03 granule (or the UTC offset from the start of the granule to the end), add UTC time to the number of seconds since the start of the granule, where UTC start time is in /ancillary_data/data_start_utc, and seconds since the start of the granule can be defined as delta_time minus /ancillary_data/start_delta_time. At this point, the end user should be able to convert between UTC and GPS, all in seconds.

      "content": "10.2.3 Apparent Return Pulse Width and Strength At times, a user may have a need to know the width and strength of the laser pulse reflected off the surface of the earth as measured by ATLAS. ATL03 provides the information needed to determine this. The photon classification algorithm indicates which photons are most likely reflections from the surface of the Earth. Depending on a user’s needs, the high- medium- and/or low-confidence signal photons can be aggregated for some distance along track (or some number of consecutive shots). The standard deviation of the heights of these photons provides a metric for the return pulse width, although other metrics are of course possible to calculate. The return pulse strength can be estimated by dividing the number of high- medium- and low-confidence photons by the number of laser shots in the aggregation. Care should be taken in determining a suitable along-track aggregation, as surface topographic variation will broaden the apparent width of the returned pulse. A longer aggregation time will improve the statistics on the signal strength, but decrease the resolution of the return pulse width. ATL04 uses the ATL03 medium- and high-confidence signal photons aggregated every 400 shots along with a radiometric correction algorithm to account for photons missed as a result of the detector dead time (see Cal- 34: Dead time dependent radiometric signal loss) in order to estimate the surface reflectance in the ATL04 data product. See the ATL04 ATBD for complete details. 10.2.4 Use of the TEP as the system impulse-response function ATL03 provides the normalized TEP histograms for the two strong beams which receive TEP photons.

We therefore suggest the following checks before a higher-level algorithm uses the TEP: (a) If the TEP histogram is to be used as a proxy for the system impulse response function, we recommend using the region between 15 and 30 nanoseconds to avoid the secondary TEP return. (b) if the primary TEP return has a full-width at half max value greater than 3 nanoseconds, we recommend not using this particular realization of the TEP as a proxy for the system impulse response. With sufficient on-orbit TEP data, we intend to refine these guidelines to automate rejection of spurious TEP realizations. 10.2.5 HDF5 Dataset Information Dataset are the primary data storage containers within a HDF5 file. A dataset contains either a scalar or (more likely) homogeneous arrays of data. Datasets, like Attributes, are assigned a datatype. In addition, there are several different storage methodologies used for efficiently storing the data. Designer creates 'empty' datasets. This allows Designer to focus generically on the organization of the data product and leave the heavy data processing to external science software. ICESat-2 datasets, by default, include a set of standard attributes corresponding to selected CF convention parameter-level metadata fields. The method of editing these attributes is through the Designer Dataset interface (not the Attribute interface).",

      "content": "Some programmer hints for modifying the default attributes are found in the Customization section. Datasets can be created using one of several storage types: Compact, Contiguous and Chunked. Each storage type has different size/performance characteristics and processing/storage overhead. The choice of storage types should be based on knowledge of the characteristics of the data to be stored. Compact is the most efficient storage for a very small amount of data. It has very low overhead, but cannot be extended. ICESat-2 uses compact datasets to store such things as processing constants or other metadata-type information that is more suitable for a dataset than an attribute. The contiguous storage type is useful for storing data that are of predictable size and limited volume. ICESat-2 uses contiguous datasets for static dimension scales. Since the data are stored in a contiguous address space on the product, this storage type has fairly low overhead. Contiguous storage must be read/written as a whole. Chunked storage trades added complexity for flexibility and performance. The primary benefit of a chunked dataset is that is can be extended. This is the feature that enables Designer to create 'empty' datasets of indeterminable size. Instead of contiguous address space, chunked datatypes are split into discrete 'chunks' of data using a B-tree index. This is very similar to the method by -- 197 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 182 which an operating system writes a file using different sectors of physical storage media. In addition, a filter pipeline is supported for chunked datasets. This pipeline includes filters such as shuffle and compression that can significantly reduce the size of the data as stored on media.

Since partial IO is made possible by chunks, a chunk is the minimum amount of data that MUST be read/written. A smaller amount of data can be requested (and processed), but data is internally read and processed in multiples of the chunk size. Matching chunk size to the possible use cases is a bit of black magic. However, in general, it is more efficient to read/write data as a multiple of the chunk size and never attempt to read data smaller than a chunk. Nearly all ICESat-2 Datasets, except for those compact and contiguous cases mentions used chunked storage. These datasets usually are internally compressed using the shuffle filter with GZIP level 6 compression and have chunk sizes of at least 10,000. In testing, the combination of the shuffle filter and level 6 compression reduce file sizes by as much as 50%. Unlimited is the term used when referring to extensible, chunked dimensions. Since HDF5 I/O is basically a memory copy to the HDF5 storage layer, the row/column order difference between C-based languages and Fortran-based languages leads to a potential issue with multi-dimension arrays. This cautionary note appears elsewhere with the Help pages, but is repeated here because of its importance. Cautionary Note: The ICESat-2 Standard Data Products are written using the HDF5 Fortran-2003 interface. The HDF5 documentation provides this warning about multi- dimension arrays written using Fortran: When a C application reads data stored from a Fortran program, the data will appear to be transposed due to the difference in the C and Fortran storage orders. For example, if Fortran writes a 4x6 two-dimensional dataset to the file, a C program will read it as a 6x4 two- dimensional dataset into memory. The HDF5 C utilities h5dump and h5ls will also display transposed data, if data is written from a Fortran program.",

Some naming conventions are borrowed from Spots, Channels and Redundancy Assignments (ICESat-2-ATSYS-TN-0910) by P. Luers. Some conventions are different than those used by the ATLAS team for the purposes of making the data processing and interpretation simpler. Spots. The ATLAS instrument creates six spots on the ground, three weak and three strong, where strong is defined as approximately four times brighter than weak. These designations apply to both the laser-illuminated spots and the instrument fields of view. The spots are numbered as shown in figure 1. At times, the weak spots are leading (when the direction of travel -- 199 of 211 -- ICESat-2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photons (ATL03) Release 006 Release Date: Fall 2022 184 is in the ATLAS +x direction) and at times the strong spots are leading. However, the spot name (1L, 1R, 2L, …) does not change based on the orientation of the spacecraft. Not: beams, footprints. Laser Pulse. Individual pulses of light emitted from the ATLAS laser are called laser pulses. As the pulse passes through the ATLAS transmit optics, this single pulse is split into six individual transmit pulses by the diffractive optical element.

      "content": "Some attributes of a laser pulse are the wavelength, pulse shape and duration. Not: transmit pulse, laser shot, laser fire. Laser Beam. The sequential laser pulses emitted from the ATLAS instrument that illuminate spots on the earth’s surface are called laser beams. ATLAS generates six laser beams. The laser beam numbering convention follows the ATLAS instrument convention with strong beams numbered 1, 3, and 5 and weak beams numbered 2, 4, and 6 as shown in the figures. These beams occupy different spots on the ground depending on the spacecraft orientation. Not: beamlet. Reflected Pulse. Individual transmit pulses reflected off the surface of the earth and viewed by the ATLAS telescope are called reflected pulses. For a given transmit pulse, there may or may not be a reflected pulse. Not: received pulse, returned pulse. Photon Event. Some of the energy in a reflected pulse passes through the ATLAS receiver optics and electronics. ATLAS detects and time tags some fraction of the photons that make up the reflected pulse, as well as background photons due to sunlight or instrument noise. Any photon that is time tagged by the ATLAS instrument is called a photon event, regardless of source. Or: received photon, detected photon. Reference Ground Track (RGT). The reference ground track (RGT) is the track on the earth at which a specified unit vector within the observatory is pointed. Under nominal operating conditions, there will be no data collected along the RGT, as the RGT is spanned by GT2L and GT2R (which are not shown in the figures, but are similar to the GTs that are shown). During spacecraft slews or off-pointing, it is possible that ground tracks may intersect the RGT. The precise unit vector has not yet been defined. The ICESat-2 mission has 1,387 RGTs, numbered from 0001xx to 1387xx. The last two digits refer to the cycle number. Not: ground tracks, paths, sub-satellite track. Cycle Number.",

The cycle number tracks the number of 91-day periods that have elapsed since the ICESat-2 observatory entered the science orbit. The first 91-day cycle is numbered 01, the second 91-day cycle is 02, and so on. At the end of the first 3 years of operations, we expect the cycle number to be 12. The cycle number will be carried in the mid-latitudes, though the same RGTs will (in general) not be targeted more than once.

The sub-satellite track (SST) is the time-ordered series of latitude and longitude points at the geodetic nadir of the ICESat-2 observatory. In order to protect the ATLAS detectors from damage due to specular returns, and the natural variation of the position of the observatory with respect to the RGT throughout the orbit, the SST is generally not the same as the RGT. Not: reference ground track, ground track. Sub-satellite Point (SSP). The sub-satellite Point (SSP) is a latitude and longitude of the point at the geodetic nadir of the ICESat-2 observatory at one point in time. See SST for further information. This point should be the reference position for relative pointing control- meaning the off-nadir angle calculated is relative to this predicted location. Ground Tracks (GT). As ICESat-2 orbits the earth, sequential transmit pulses illuminate six ground tracks on the surface of the earth. The track width is approximately the diameter of the spot on the surface which is approximately 17 meters** wide. Ground tracks are always numbered with 1L on the far left of the spot pattern and 3R on the far right of the spot pattern.",

The pair track is the imaginary line half way between the actual locations of the strong and weak ground tracks that make up a pair. There are three PTs: PT1 is spanned by GT1L and GT1R, PT2 is spanned by GT2L and GT2R (and may be coincident with the RGT at times), PT3 is spanned by GT3L and GT3R. Note that this is the actual location of the midway point between GTs, and will be defined by the actual location of the GTs. Not: tracks, paths, reference ground tracks, footpaths, reference pair tracks. Pairs. When considered together, individual strong and weak ground tracks form a pair. For example, GT2L and GT2R form the central pair of the array. The pairs are numbered 1 through 3: Pair 1 is comprised of GT1L and GT1R, pair 2 is comprised of GT2L and GT2R, and pair 3 is comprised of GT3L and 3R. Along-track. The direction of travel of the ICESat-2 observatory in the orbit frame is defined as the along-track coordinate, and is denoted as the +x direction. The positive x direction is therefore along the Earth-centered Earth-fixed velocity vector of the observatory. Each pair has a unique coordinate system, with the +x direction aligned with the reference pair tracks. Across-track. The across-track coordinate is y and is positive to the left, with the origins along the reference ground track. Segment. An along-track span (or aggregation) of received photon data from a single ground track or other defined track is called a segment. A segment can be measured as a time duration (e.g. from the time of the first received photon to the time of the last received photon), as a distance (e.g. the distance between the location of the first and last received photons), or as an accumulation of a desired number of photons. Segments can be as short or as long as desired. Signal Photon. Any photon event that an algorithm determines to be part of the reflected pulse.",

Background photons could be due to noise in the ATLAS instrument (e.g. stray light, or detector dark counts), sunlight, or mis-classified signal photons. Not: noise photon. h_**. Signal photons will be used by higher-level products to determine height above the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid, using a semi-major axis (equatorial radius) of 6,378,137 meters and a flattening of 1/298.257223563. This can be abbreviated as ‘ellipsoidal height’ or ‘height above ellipsoid’. These heights are denoted by h; the subscript ** will refer to the specific algorithm used to determine that elevation (e.g. is = ice sheet algorithm, si = sea ice algorithm, etc…). Not: elevation. Photon Cloud. The collection of all telemetered photon time tags in a given segment is the (or a) photon cloud. Or: point cloud. Background Count Rate. The number of background photons in a given time span is the background count rate. Therefore a value of the background count rate requires a segment of received photons and an algorithm to distinguish signal and background photons. Not: Noise rate, background rate. Noise Count Rate. The rate at which the ATLAS instrument receives photons in the absence of any light entering the ATLAS telescope or receiver optics. The noise count rate includes received photons due to detector dark counts or stray light from within the instrument. Not: noise rate, background rate, background count rate. Telemetry band. The subset of received photons selected by the science algorithm on board ATLAS to be telemetered to the ground is called the telemetry band. The width of the telemetry band is a function of the signal to noise ratio of the data (calculated by the science algorithm onboard ATLAS), the location on the earth (e.g.",

The telemetry band width is described in section 7 or the ATLAS Flight Science Receiver Algorithms document. The total volume of telemetered photon events must meet the data volume constraint (currently 577 GBits/day). Window, Window Width, Window Duration. A subset of the telemetry band of received photons is called a window. If the vertical extent of a window is defined in terms of distance, the window is said to have a width. If the vertical extent of a window is defined in terms of time, the window is said to have a duration. The window width is always less than or equal to the telemetry band. Or: vertical window, range window Window Folding. As a result of the 10 kHz laser pulse repetition frequency, consecutive pulses are spaced by 30 km in flight leading to a 15 km height ambiguity. Therefore, photons reflecting off clouds above 15 km or higher above the Earth surface are assigned artificially low heights 15 km below the actual cloud height. While in general it isn’t possible to automatically detect and correct these, at times geophysical (or geographic) context can help a user identify this situation on a case-by-case basis.

Heights are provided in the ITRF2014 reference frame; geographic coordinates are referenced to the WGS84 ellipsoid. File Information 1.2.1 Format Data are provided as HDF5 formatted files. 1.2.2 ATLAS/ICESat-2 Description NOTE: The following brief description of the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) observatory and Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument is provided to help users better understand the file naming conventions, internal structure of data files, and other details referenced by this user guide. The ATL03 data product is described in detail in the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 Project Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for Global Geolocated Photon Data (ATBD for ATL03 V6 | https://doi.org/10.5067/GA5KCLJT7LOT). The ICESat-2 observatory utilizes a photon-counting lidar (the ATLAS instrument) and ancillary systems (GPS, star cameras, and ground processing) to measure the time a photon takes to travel from ATLAS to Earth and back again and determine the reflected photon's geodetic latitude and longitude. Laser pulses from ATLAS illuminate three left/right pairs of spots on the surface that trace out six approximately 14 m wide ground tracks as ICESat-2 orbits Earth. Each ground track is numbered according to the laser spot number that generates it, with ground track 1L (GT1L) on the far left and ground track 3R (GT3R) on the far right. Left/right spots within each pair are approximately 90 m apart in the across-track direction and 2.5 km in the along-track direction.",

      "content": "Higher level ATLAS/ICESat-2 data products (ATL03 and above) are organized by ground track, with ground tracks 1L and 1R forming pair one, ground tracks 2L and 2R forming pair two, and ground tracks 3L and 3R forming pair three. Each pair also has a Pair Track—an imaginary line halfway between the actual location of the left and right beams (see Figure 1). Pair tracks are approximately 3 km apart in the across-track direction. The beams within each pair have different transmit energies—so-called weak and strong beams— with an energy ratio between them of approximately 1:4. The mapping between the strong and weak beams of ATLAS, and their relative position on the ground, depends on the orientation (yaw) -- 3 of 23 -- USER GUIDE: ATLAS/ICESat-2 L2A Global Geolocated Photon Data, Version 6 Page 3 of 22 National Snow and Ice Data Center nsidc.org of the ICESat-2 observatory, which is changed approximately twice per year to maximize solar illumination of the solar panels. The forward orientation corresponds to ATLAS traveling along the +x coordinate in the ATLAS instrument reference frame (see Figure 1, left). In this orientation, the weak beams lead the strong beams and a weak beam is on the left edge of the beam pattern. In the backward orientation, ATLAS travels along the -x coordinate, in the instrument reference frame, with the strong beams leading the weak beams and a strong beam on the left edge of the beam pattern (see Figure 1, right). The first yaw flip was performed on 28 December 2018, placing the spacecraft into the backward orientation. The current spacecraft orientation, as well as a history of previous yaw flips, is available in the ICESat-2 Major Activities tracking document (.xlsx). The Reference Ground Track (RGT) refers to the imaginary track on Earth at which a specified unit vector within the observatory is pointed.",

      "content": "During nominal operating conditions onboard software aims the laser beams so that the RGT is between ground tracks 2L and 2R (i.e., coincident with Pair Track 2). The ICESat-2 mission acquires data along 1,387 different RGTs. Each RGT is targeted in the polar regions once every 91 days to allow elevation changes to be detected. Cycle numbers track the number of 91-day periods that have elapsed since the ICESat-2 observatory entered the science orbit. RGTs are uniquely identified, for example in ATL02 file names, by appending the two-digit cycle number (cc) to the RGT number, e.g., 0001cc to 1387cc. Figure 1. Spot and ground track (GT) naming convention with ATLAS oriented in the forward (instrument coordinate +x) direction and backward (instrument coordinate -x) direction. NOTE: ICESat-2 reference ground tracks with dates and times can be downloaded as KMZ files from NASA's ICESat-2 | Technical Specs page below the Orbit and Coverage table. Under normal operating conditions, data are not collected along the RGT; however, during spacecraft slews, or off-pointing, some ground tracks may intersect the RGT. Off-pointing refers to a series of plans over the mid-latitudes that have been designed to facilitate a global ground and canopy height data product with approximately 2 km track spacing. Off-pointing began on 1 August -- 4 of 23 -- USER GUIDE: ATLAS/ICESat-2 L2A Global Geolocated Photon Data, Version 6 Page 4 of 22 National Snow and Ice Data Center nsidc.org 2019 with RGT 518, after the ATLAS/ICESat-2 PPD and POD solutions had been adequately resolved and the instrument had pointed directly at the reference ground track for at least a full 91 days (1,387 orbits). Users should note that sometimes, for various reasons, the spacecraft pointing may lead to ICESat-2 data collected offset at some distance from the RGTs instead of along the nominal RGT. Although not along the nominal RGT, the geolocation information and data quality for these data are not degraded.",

Browse files contain: • Maps of medium- and high-confidence reference photon locations for each of the three strong beams. These three maps indicate where the signal-to-noise ratio in a given granule is good. Photon classifications in these maps are surface-type dependent; they plot the highest confidence for a given photon. For example, if a photon is classified as high- confidence signal for surface type A and medium confidence for surface type B, then surface type A is plotted. • Plots of the low-, medium-, and high-confidence signal photon ellipsoidal elevations versus geolocation segment id number for each surface type, for each of the three strong beams. As many as 15 of these images can exist per granule: three for each of the five surface types. They offer users a depiction of the low-, medium-, and high-confidence photon clouds for each of the three strong beams. Low-confidence photons are plotted first, followed by the medium- and high-confidence photons. Thus, low confidence photons are generally only prominently visible if relatively few high- or medium- confidence photons exist in a particular segment. • A plot that shows the background rate (stored in /gt[x]/bckgrd_atlas/bckgrd_rate) for the entire granule versus time since the start of the granule for the three strong beams. This image provides a sense of the variation in the background photon rate. • Elevations for the low-, medium-, and high-confidence signal photons plotted in three dimensions.

It acts as the bridge between the lower level, instrumentation-specific products and the higher-level, surface-specific products (ATL06 and above). By design, ATL03 is a single source for all photon data and ancillary information that the higher-level products need, including spacecraft and instrument parameters. For example, stored within ATL03 is the ATLAS impulse-response function utilized by the sea ice height and ocean height algorithms, as well as land ice, sea ice, ocean, land, and inland water surface masks. Although this information is not explicitly required to generate ATL03, it is included to facilitate subsequent data products.",

The Precision Pointing Determination (PPD) and Precision Orbit Determination (POD) solutions compute the pointing vector and position of the ICESat-2 observatory. Acquisition The ATLAS instrument transmits green (532 nm) laser pulses at 10 kHz. At the nominal ICESat-2 orbit altitude of 500 km, this yields approximately one transmitted laser pulse every 0.7 meters along ground tracks. Each transmitted laser pulse is split by a diffractive optical element in ATLAS to generate six individual beams, arranged in three pairs. Within each pair, the beams have different transmit energies—so-called weak and strong beams with an energy ratio of -- 14 of 23 -- USER GUIDE: ATLAS/ICESat-2 L2A Global Geolocated Photon Data, Version 6 Page 14 of 22 National Snow and Ice Data Center nsidc.org approximately 1:4—and are separated by 90 m in the across-track direction and approximately 2.5 km in the along-track direction. The distance between beam pairs is approximately 3 km in the across-track direction (see Figure ). Approximately 1014 photons leave the ATLAS sensor with each pulse and travel through the atmosphere to Earth. Of those which reflect off the surface, approximately 10 travel back through the atmosphere and into the ATLAS telescope, where their arrival is time-tagged by the instrument's electronics. If the sun is illuminating Earth's surface at the same time, background photons from sunlight also enter the telescope and are recorded. Any photon that is time-tagged by ATLAS, regardless of source, is referred to as a photon event.",

Based on pre-launch testing of the ATLAS photon-counting system, the algorithm assumes that background photon events recorded by ATLAS follow a Poisson distribution, and therefore outliers to this distribution represent possible signal photons. To make this discrimination, the algorithm constructs histograms with photon events aggregated into along- track and vertical bins. According to Poisson statistics, background photon events are thus randomly distributed among the bins while signal photons cluster into one or a few bins. The algorithm is driven by numerous input parameters, many of which are surface-type dependent, to optimize signal detection while minimizing execution time. Given the background rate, the algorithm calculates a signal threshold and then generates a histogram of photon ellipsoidal heights (above the WGS 84 ellipsoid).",

      "content": "It then distinguishes signal photons from background photons as those that pass a series of tests dependent on the signal threshold. Surface slopes present one of the main challenges to identifying signal photon events because they are not known a priori. The algorithm histograms photon event heights relative to the ellipsoid, stepping through the data granule in uniform time increments (Δtime). For each Δtime, the algorithm histograms the photon events over an integration time, δt, at a vertical resolution, δz. The algorithm automatically adjusts δt and δz until it either identifies vertical bins that contain more photon events than a threshold based on the background count distribution, or it reaches a pre- defined limit on δt and δz without identifying any bins that contain signal photon events for a given Δtime. This automatic adjustment allows the algorithm to maintain the highest resolution possible in terms of the histogram bin dimensions. After the algorithm identifies possible signal photon events, it selects additional bins to ensure inclusion of all signal photon events. Ellipsoidal-based histograms allow for signal photon events to be readily identified over low-slope regions. However, when this approach is applied over sloped surfaces it can spread the signal photon events across several bins, making it less likely that the algorithm will correctly identify bins that contain signal photon events; therefore, two additional steps are performed. First, the algorithm performs running linear fits to the surface height profile, as determined by ellipsoidal histogramming, to define the local surface slope, α. It then histograms the photon heights relative to α to search for signal returns along a linear trend determined by the adjacent surface slopes (slant histograms).",

Photon events that are characterized as likely signal are then binned in approximately 20 m along-track segments that are fixed to the RGT in predetermined locations and a reference photon is selected. These segments are referred to as the along-track geolocation segments. The atmospheric path delay and its derivatives with respect to ellipsoid height are then computed for the reference photon and used to correct the geodetic coordinates of all photons within the segment.

When the observatory is pointed to the RGT, this means that photon along-track x-values range from 0 m to approximately 20 m. The across-track y-values run from approximately -3.3 km to +3.3 km. The boundaries between consecutive along-track geolocation segments (where x resets to 0 from its maximum value of ~20 m) are not co-linear due to the curvature of the ground tracks on the surface of the earth. Consequently, while the length of the along-track segments along the RGT are nominally 20 m for left and right ground track pairs, they could be greater or less than 20 m depending on the curvature of the ground tracks on the surface of the Earth. 2.3.5 Range Bias Correction Details on range bias correction can be found in “Section 3.3 | ATLAS Range Bias Correction and Uncertainty” of the ATL03 ATBD. The primary measurement of the ICESat-2 mission is the height of the Earth’s surface. Potential sources of measurement bias, as well as bias uncertainty, are evaluated. The ATLAS zero-range distance was measured before launch to account for optical and electrical path lengths within the instrument for many permutations of ATLAS settings and configurations (documented in the ATLAS pre-launch calibration product CAL-08).",

The overall height uncertainty estimate is provided at the along-track geolocation segment rate and contributes to sigma_h. NOTE: For ATL03 Versions 1–4, the range bias was calculated from pre-launch analysis and instrument calibration. This range bias correction was beam-specific and constant over time. Beginning with Version 5, the range bias correction is dynamically calculated to include time- and temperature-dependent corrections from on-orbit calibration data. The mean offset between the pre-launch (Version 4 and lower) and post-launch (Version 5 and higher) range bias correction is about 1.2 cm. An additional time- dependent range bias on the order of ± 2 mm is indicated by the analysis of on-orbit calibrations over the first two years of the mission. The temperature-dependent portion of the range bias correction is < 0.1 mm over two orbits. 2.3.6 Surface Masks ATL03 includes gridded surface masks (land ice, sea ice, land, ocean, and inland water) to reduce the volume of data that must be processed to generate the surface-specific higher-level ICESat-2 -- 19 of 23 -- USER GUIDE: ATLAS/ICESat-2 L2A Global Geolocated Photon Data, Version 6 Page 19 of 22 National Snow and Ice Data Center nsidc.org data products.

To protect against errors of omission in these masks, a buffer has been added to the best estimate of the geographic bounds of regions of interest. Consequently, the grids do not perfectly tessellate the surface of the Earth and overlap each other on the order of tens of kilometers in most regions.",

In general, the surface is classified with high confidence up to a few MHz of background photon events. As the background photon rate increases, the fraction of medium and low-confidence photons increases. Above approximately 10 MHz, the algorithm identifies relatively few photons with a high degree of confidence and the surface becomes predominantly classified with low confidence. As the background rate increases, summing the high-, medium-, and low-confidence signal photon events yields a similar total number of likely signal photons. It is the relative fraction of each classification that changes. Authors of each of the higher-level surface-specific ICESat-2 ATBDs that draw on the ATL03 data product have provided guidance regarding the fidelity to which the ATL03 algorithm needs to discriminate signal and background photon events. In general, each higher-level data product requires ATL03 to identify likely signal photon events within ±10 meters of the surface.

Table 6 below shows spot-specific mean offsets and standard deviations. -- 22 of 23 -- USER GUIDE: ATLAS/ICESat-2 L2A Global Geolocated Photon Data, Version 6 Page 22 of 22 National Snow and Ice Data Center nsidc.org Table 6.
